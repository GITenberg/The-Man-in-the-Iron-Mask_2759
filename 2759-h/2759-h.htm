        Transcriber&rsquo;s Notes:
      </h2>
      <p>
        As you may be aware, Project Gutenberg has been involved with the
        writings of both the Alexandre Dumases for some time now, and since we
        get a few questions about the order in which the books should be read,
        and in which they were published, these following comments should
        hopefully help most of our readers.
      </p>
      ***
      <p>
        The Vicomte de Bragelonne is the final volume of D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances: it
        is usually split into three or four parts, and the final portion is
        entitled The Man in the Iron Mask. The Man in the Iron Mask we&rsquo;re
        familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition. [Not
        all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the
        confusion...but wait...there&rsquo;s yet more reason for confusion.]
      </p>
      <p>
        We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four etexts
        entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la
        Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,
        entitled Ten Years Later, says it&rsquo;s the sequel to The Three Musketeers.
        While this is technically true, there&rsquo;s another book, Twenty Years
        After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts
        that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years
        After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty
        Years &ldquo;After&rdquo; the original story...however, this is why the different
        words &ldquo;After&rdquo; and &ldquo;Later&rdquo;...the Ten Years &ldquo;After&rdquo; is ten years after the
        Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the
        D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the
        subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different
        volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the
        first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later can,
        similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the
        four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,
        it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material
        in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the
        series which may prove helpful:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257&mdash;First book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan
        Romances. Covers the years 1625-1628.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty Years After: Etext 1259&mdash;Second book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan
        Romances. Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we
        published, but second in time sequence!!!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten Years Later: Etext 1258&mdash;First 104 chapters of the third book
        of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)&mdash;First
        75 chapters of the third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the
        year 1660.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (second in the new series)&mdash;Chapters
        76-140 of that third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
        1660-1661. [In this particular editing of it]
      </p>
      <p>
        Louise de la Valliere: Etext 2710 (third in the new series)&mdash;Chapters
        141-208 of the third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the year
        1661.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Man in the Iron Mask: Etext 2759 (our next text)&mdash;Chapters
        209-269 of the third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
        1661-1673.

      <h2>
        Introduction:
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le Siecle, the
        first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated playwright
        Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had
        found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a
        history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures
        of a young man named D&rsquo;Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost
        immediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and
        ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers
        would enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends,
        Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the
        scenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English
        history.
      </p>

        Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form, and
        became the three D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief
        summary of the first two novels:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Three Musketeers (serialized March&mdash;July, 1844): The year is
        1625. The young D&rsquo;Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and
        almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.
        Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal&rsquo;s
        guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.
        The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s landlord
        to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them
        across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the
        Cardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,
        named simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of
        Austria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the
        four friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty Years After (serialized January&mdash;August, 1845): The year is
        now 1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has
        died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit
        upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV, the
        real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.
        D&rsquo;Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have
        retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de
        la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.
        Aramis, whose real name is D&rsquo;Herblay, has followed his intention of
        shedding the musketeer&rsquo;s cassock for the priest&rsquo;s robes, and Porthos has
        married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But
        trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the
        institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at
        home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D&rsquo;Artagnan brings
        his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,
        but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother&rsquo;s death
        at the musketeers&rsquo; hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our
        heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,
        quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October, 1847&mdash;January,
        1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English translation. It has
        been split into three, four, or five volumes at various points in its
        history. The five-volume edition generally does not give titles to the
        smaller portions, but the others do. In the three-volume edition, the
        novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Louise de la Valliere,
        and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of this etext, I have
        chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition does, with these
        titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la
        Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the first three etexts:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and
        D&rsquo;Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become
        disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with
        the Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on
        his own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,
        and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune
        in the process. D&rsquo;Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich
        citizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king&rsquo;s
        brother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own
        estate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to
        assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly
        Mazarin&rsquo;s trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,
        the king&rsquo;s superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any means
        necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant
        bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet&rsquo;s
        loyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king&rsquo;s attention
        that Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could
        possibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation
        against the king. Louis calls D&rsquo;Artagnan out of retirement and sends him
        to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his
        long-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At
        Belle-Isle, D&rsquo;Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications
        is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that&rsquo;s not all. The
        blueprints for the island, although in Porthos&rsquo;s handwriting, show
        evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.
        D&rsquo;Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,
        which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting
        that D&rsquo;Artagnan has arrived on the king&rsquo;s behalf to investigate, Aramis
        tricks D&rsquo;Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos, and
        sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of the
        danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a
        present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating
        Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an
        audience with the king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of
        England arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into
        complete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is in
        love with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre,
        thankfully prevented by Raoul&rsquo;s timely and tactful intervention. After
        the marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of
        Buckingham, and has him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke fights
        a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and
        spiteful man, the sworn enemy of D&rsquo;Artagnan, and, by the same token,
        that of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are
        seriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.
        Raoul&rsquo;s friend, the Comte de Guiche, is the next to succumb to
        Henrietta&rsquo;s charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De
        Guiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then the king&rsquo;s eye falls on
        Madame Henrietta during the comte&rsquo;s absence, and this time Monsieur&rsquo;s
        jealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and
        his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king can
        pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair. They
        unfortunately select Louise de la Valliere, Raoul&rsquo;s fiancee. While the
        court is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears
        Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends
        beneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for
        Madame. That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De Guiche
        confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their own
        affair. A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise are
        trapped alone together, and the whole court begins to talk of the
        scandal while their love affair blossoms. Aware of Louise&rsquo;s attachment,
        the king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite
        period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.
        Although the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask
        Fouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it
        for him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his
        new mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels
        and her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown
        friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that
        Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D&rsquo;Artagnan while inquiring of him as
        to Aramis&rsquo;s whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the
        musketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden
        overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet had
        already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the
        governor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable
        resemblance to Louis XIV&mdash;in fact, the two are identical. He uses
        the existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the
        general of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new
        general of the order. On Aramis&rsquo;s advice, hoping to use Louise&rsquo;s
        influence with the king to counteract Colbert&rsquo;s influence, Fouquet also
        writes a love letter to La Valliere, unfortunately undated. It never
        reaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it
        turns out to be an agent of Colbert&rsquo;s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Louise de la Valliere (Etext 2710): Believing D&rsquo;Artagnan occupied at
        Fontainebleau and Porthos safely tucked away at Paris, Aramis holds a
        funeral for the dead Franciscan&mdash;but in fact, Aramis is wrong in
        both suppositions. D&rsquo;Artagnan has left Fontainebleau, bored to tears by
        the <i>fetes</i>, retrieved Porthos, and is visiting the country-house
        of Planchet, his old lackey. This house happens to be right next door to
        the graveyard, and upon observing Aramis at this funeral, and his
        subsequent meeting with a mysterious hooded lady, D&rsquo;Artagnan, suspicions
        aroused, resolves to make a little trouble for the bishop. He presents
        Porthos to the king at the same time as Fouquet presents Aramis, thereby
        surprising the wily prelate. Aramis&rsquo;s professions of affection and
        innocence do only a little to allay D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s concerns, and he
        continues to regard Aramis&rsquo;s actions with a curious and wary eye.
        Meanwhile, much to his delight, Porthos is invited to dine with the king
        as a result of his presentation, and with D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s guidance, manages
        to behave in such a manner as to procure the king&rsquo;s marked favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mysterious woman turns out to be the Duchesse de Chevreuse, a
        notorious schemer and former friend of Anne of Austria. She comes
        bearing more bad news for Fouquet, who is already in trouble, as the
        king has invited himself to a <i>fete</i> at Vaux, Fouquet&rsquo;s magnificent
        mansion, that will surely bankrupt the poor superintendent. The Duchesse
        has letters from Mazarin that prove that Fouquet has received thirteen
        million francs from the royal coffers, and she wishes to sell these
        letters to Aramis. Aramis refuses, and the letters are instead sold to
        Colbert. Fouquet, meanwhile, discovers that the receipt that proves his
        innocence in the affair has been stolen from him. Even worse, Fouquet,
        desperate for money, is forced to sell the parliamentary position that
        renders him untouchable by any court proceedings. As part of her deal
        with Colbert, though, Chevreuse also obtains a secret audience with the
        queen-mother, where the two discuss a shocking secret&mdash;Louis XIV
        has a twin brother, long believed, however, to be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, in other quarters, De Wardes, Raoul&rsquo;s inveterate enemy, has
        returned from Calais, barely recovered from his wounds, and no sooner
        does he return than he begins again to insult people, particularly La
        Valliere, and this time the comte de Guiche is the one to challenge him.
        The duel leaves De Guiche horribly wounded, but enables Madame to use
        her influence to destroy De Wardes&rsquo;s standing at court. The <i>fetes</i>,
        however, come to an end, and the court returns to Paris. The king has
        been more than obvious about his affections for Louise, and Madame, the
        queen-mother, and the queen join forces to destroy her. She is
        dishonorably discharged from court, and in despair, she flees to the
        convent at Chaillot. Along the way, though, she runs into D&rsquo;Artagnan,
        who manages to get word back to the king of what has taken place. By
        literally begging Madame in tears, Louis manages to secure Louise&rsquo;s
        return to court&mdash;but Madame still places every obstacle possible
        before the lovers. They have to resort to building a secret staircase
        and meeting in the apartments of M. de Saint-Aignan, where Louis has a
        painter create a portrait of Louise. But Madame recalls Raoul from
        London and shows him these proofs of Louise&rsquo;s infidelity. Raoul,
        crushed, challenges Saint-Aignan to a duel, which the king prevents, and
        Athos, furious, breaks his sword before the king. The king has
        D&rsquo;Artagnan arrest Athos, and at the Bastile they encounter Aramis, who
        is paying Baisemeaux another visit. Raoul learns of Athos&rsquo;s arrest, and
        with Porthos in tow, they effect a daring rescue, surprising the
        carriage containing D&rsquo;Artagnan and Athos as they leave the Bastile.
        Although quite impressive, the intrepid raid is in vain, as D&rsquo;Artagnan
        has already secured Athos&rsquo;s pardon from the king. Instead, everybody
        switches modes of transport; D&rsquo;Artagnan and Porthos take the horses back
        to Paris, and Athos and Raoul take the carriage back to La Fere, where
        they intend to reside permanently, as the king is now their sworn enemy,
        Raoul cannot bear to see Louise, and they have no more dealings in
        Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aramis, left alone with Baisemeaux, inquires the governor of the prison
        about his loyalties, in particular to the Jesuits. The bishop reveals
        that he is a confessor of the society, and invokes their regulations in
        order to obtain access to this mysterious prisoner who bears such a
        striking resemblance to Louis XIV...
      </p>
      <p>
        And so Baisemeaux is conducting Aramis to the prisoner as the final
        section of The Vicomte de Bragelonne and this final story of the
        D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances opens. I have written a &ldquo;Cast of Historical
        Characters,&rdquo; Etext 2760, that will enable curious readers to compare
        personages in the novel with their historical counterparts. Also of
        interest may be an essay Dumas wrote on the possible identity of the
        real Man in the Iron Mask, which is Etext 2751. Enjoy!

    <h2>
      Chapter I. The Prisoner.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since Aramis&rsquo;s singular transformation into a confessor of the order,
      Baisemeaux was no longer the same man. Up to that period, the place which
      Aramis had held in the worthy governor&rsquo;s estimation was that of a prelate
      whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of gratitude; but
      now he felt himself an inferior, and that Aramis was his master. He
      himself lighted a lantern, summoned a turnkey, and said, returning to
      Aramis, &ldquo;I am at your orders, monseigneur.&rdquo; Aramis merely nodded his head,
      as much as to say, &ldquo;Very good&rdquo;; and signed to him with his hand to lead
      the way. Baisemeaux advanced, and Aramis followed him. It was a calm and
      lovely starlit night; the steps of three men resounded on the flags of the
      terraces, and the clinking of the keys hanging from the jailer&rsquo;s girdle
      made itself heard up to the stories of the towers, as if to remind the
      prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury beyond their reach. It
      might have been said that the alteration effected in Baisemeaux extended
      even to the prisoners. The turnkey, the same who, on Aramis&rsquo;s first
      arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious, was now not only
      silent, but impassible. He held his head down, and seemed afraid to keep
      his ears open. In this wise they reached the basement of the Bertaudiere,
      the two first stories of which were mounted silently and somewhat slowly;
      for Baisemeaux, though far from disobeying, was far from exhibiting any
      eagerness to obey. On arriving at the door, Baisemeaux showed a
      disposition to enter the prisoner&rsquo;s chamber; but Aramis, stopping him on
      the threshold, said, &ldquo;The rules do not allow the governor to hear the
      prisoner&rsquo;s confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux bowed, and made way for Aramis, who took the lantern and
      entered; and then signed to them to close the door behind him. For an
      instant he remained standing, listening whether Baisemeaux and the turnkey
      had retired; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their
      descending footsteps that they had left the tower, he put the lantern on
      the table and gazed around. On a bed of green serge, similar in all
      respect to the other beds in the Bastile, save that it was newer, and
      under curtains half-drawn, reposed a young man, to whom we have already
      once before introduced Aramis. According to custom, the prisoner was
      without a light. At the hour of curfew, he was bound to extinguish his
      lamp, and we perceive how much he was favored, in being allowed to keep it
      burning even till then. Near the bed a large leathern armchair, with
      twisted legs, sustained his clothes. A little table&mdash;without pens,
      books, paper, or ink&mdash;stood neglected in sadness near the window;
      while several plates, still unemptied, showed that the prisoner had
      scarcely touched his evening meal. Aramis saw that the young man was
      stretched upon his bed, his face half concealed by his arms. The arrival
      of a visitor did not caused any change of position; either he was waiting
      in expectation, or was asleep. Aramis lighted the candle from the lantern,
      pushed back the armchair, and approached the bed with an evident mixture
      of interest and respect. The young man raised his head. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You desired a confessor?&rdquo; replied Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you were ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man gave Aramis a piercing glance, and answered, &ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo;
       After a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;I have seen you before,&rdquo; he continued. Aramis
      bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold, crafty, and
      imperious character stamped upon the features of the bishop of Vannes was
      little reassuring to one in his situation, for he added, &ldquo;I am better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then&mdash;being better, I have no longer the same need of a
      confessor, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even of the hair-cloth, which the note you found in your bread
      informed you of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man started; but before he had either assented or denied, Aramis
      continued, &ldquo;Not even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to hear an
      important revelation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be so,&rdquo; said the young man, sinking again on his pillow, &ldquo;it is
      different; I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis then looked at him more closely, and was struck with the easy
      majesty of his mien, one which can never be acquired unless Heaven has
      implanted it in the blood or heart. &ldquo;Sit down, monsieur,&rdquo; said the
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis bowed and obeyed. &ldquo;How does the Bastile agree with you?&rdquo; asked the
      bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not suffer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing to regret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even your liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call liberty, monsieur?&rdquo; asked the prisoner, with the tone of
      a man who is preparing for a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call liberty, the flowers, the air, light, the stars, the happiness of
      going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish to
      carry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled, whether in resignation or contempt, it was difficult
      to tell. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have in that Japanese vase two roses gathered
      yesterday evening in the bud from the governor&rsquo;s garden; this morning they
      have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath my gaze; with every
      opening petal they unfold the treasures of their perfumes, filling my
      chamber with a fragrance that embalms it. Look now on these two roses;
      even among roses these are beautiful, and the rose is the most beautiful
      of flowers. Why, then, do you bid me desire other flowers when I possess
      the loveliest of all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis gazed at the young man in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If <i>flowers</i> constitute liberty,&rdquo; sadly resumed the captive, &ldquo;I am
      free, for I possess them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the air!&rdquo; cried Aramis; &ldquo;air is so necessary to life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; returned the prisoner; &ldquo;draw near to the window; it is
      open. Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages of
      hail and lightning, exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle breezes.
      It caresses my face. When mounted on the back of this armchair, with my
      arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself, I fancy I am swimming
      the wide expanse before me.&rdquo; The countenance of Aramis darkened as the
      young man continued: &ldquo;Light I have! what is better than light? I have the
      sun, a friend who comes to visit me every day without the permission of
      the governor or the jailer&rsquo;s company. He comes in at the window, and
      traces in my room a square the shape of the window, which lights up the
      hangings of my bed and floods the very floor. This luminous square
      increases from ten o&rsquo;clock till midday, and decreases from one till three
      slowly, as if, having hastened to my presence, it sorrowed at bidding me
      farewell. When its last ray disappears I have enjoyed its presence for
      five hours. Is not that sufficient? I have been told that there are
      unhappy beings who dig in quarries, and laborers who toil in mines, who
      never behold it at all.&rdquo; Aramis wiped the drops from his brow. &ldquo;As to the
      stars which are so delightful to view,&rdquo; continued the young man, &ldquo;they all
      resemble each other save in size and brilliancy. I am a favored mortal,
      for if you had not lighted that candle you would have been able to see the
      beautiful stars which I was gazing at from my couch before your arrival,
      whose silvery rays were stealing through my brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis lowered his head; he felt himself overwhelmed with the bitter flow
      of that sinister philosophy which is the religion of the captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much, then, for the flowers, the air, the daylight, and the stars,&rdquo;
       tranquilly continued the young man; &ldquo;there remains but exercise. Do I not
      walk all day in the governor&rsquo;s garden if it is fine&mdash;here if it
      rains? in the fresh air if it is warm; in perfect warmth, thanks to my
      winter stove, if it be cold? Ah! monsieur, do you fancy,&rdquo; continued the
      prisoner, not without bitterness, &ldquo;that men have not done everything for
      me that a man can hope for or desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men!&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;be it so; but it seems to me you are forgetting
      Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I have forgotten Heaven,&rdquo; murmured the prisoner, with emotion;
      &ldquo;but why do you mention it? Of what use is it to talk to a prisoner of
      Heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked steadily at this singular youth, who possessed the
      resignation of a martyr with the smile of an atheist. &ldquo;Is not Heaven in
      everything?&rdquo; he murmured in a reproachful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather, at the end of everything,&rdquo; answered the prisoner, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;but let us return to our starting-point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask nothing better,&rdquo; returned the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you ought, as a penitent, to tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My whole desire is to tell it you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every prisoner has committed some crime for which he has been imprisoned.
      What crime, then, have you committed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked me the same question the first time you saw me,&rdquo; returned the
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, as now you evaded giving me an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what reason have you for thinking that I shall now reply to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this time I am your confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you wish me to tell what crime I have committed, explain to me in
      what a crime consists. For as my conscience does not accuse me, I aver
      that I am not a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are often criminals in the sight of the great of the earth, not alone
      for having ourselves committed crimes, but because we know that crimes
      have been committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner manifested the deepest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand you,&rdquo; he said, after a pause; &ldquo;yes, you are right,
      monsieur; it is very possible that, in such a light, I am a criminal in
      the eyes of the great of the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then you know something,&rdquo; said Aramis, who thought he had pierced not
      merely through a defect in the harness, but through the joints of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not aware of anything,&rdquo; replied the young man; &ldquo;but sometimes I
      think&mdash;and I say to myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That if I were to think but a little more deeply I should either go mad
      or I should divine a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;and then?&rdquo; said Aramis, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I leave off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; my head becomes confused and my ideas melancholy; I feel <i>ennui</i>
      overtaking me; I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but I do not like to give myself up to longing for things
      which I do not possess, when I am so happy with what I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid of death?&rdquo; said Aramis, with a slight uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young man, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis felt the chill of that smile, and shuddered. &ldquo;Oh, as you fear
      death, you know more about matters than you say,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; returned the prisoner, &ldquo;who bade me to ask to see you; you,
      who, when I did ask to see you, came here promising a world of confidence;
      how is it that, nevertheless, it is you who are silent, leaving it for me
      to speak? Since, then, we both wear masks, either let us both retain them
      or put them aside together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis felt the force and justice of the remark, saying to himself, &ldquo;This
      is no ordinary man; I must be cautious.&mdash;Are you ambitious?&rdquo; said he
      suddenly to the prisoner, aloud, without preparing him for the alteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by ambitious?&rdquo; replied the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ambition,&rdquo; replied Aramis, &ldquo;is the feeling which prompts a man to desire
      more&mdash;much more&mdash;than he possesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that I was contented, monsieur; but, perhaps, I deceive myself. I
      am ignorant of the nature of ambition; but it is not impossible I may have
      some. Tell me your mind; that is all I ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ambitious man,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;is one who covets that which is beyond
      his station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I covet nothing beyond my station,&rdquo; said the young man, with an assurance
      of manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent. But to look at the kindling eye, the knitted brow, and the
      reflective attitude of the captive, it was evident that he expected
      something more than silence,&mdash;a silence which Aramis now broke. &ldquo;You
      lied the first time I saw you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lied!&rdquo; cried the young man, starting up on his couch, with such a tone in
      his voice, and such a lightning in his eyes, that Aramis recoiled, in
      spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>should</i> say,&rdquo; returned Aramis, bowing, &ldquo;you concealed from me
      what you knew of your infancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s secrets are his own, monsieur,&rdquo; retorted the prisoner, &ldquo;and not
      at the mercy of the first chance-comer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Aramis, bowing still lower than before, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis true; pardon
      me, but to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer? I beseech
      you to reply, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This title slightly disturbed the prisoner; but nevertheless he did not
      appear astonished that it was given him. &ldquo;I do not know you, monsieur,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but if I dared, I would take your hand and kiss it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand; but the
      light which beamed in his eyes faded away, and he coldly and distrustfully
      withdrew his hand again. &ldquo;Kiss the hand of a prisoner,&rdquo; he said, shaking
      his head, &ldquo;to what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you tell me,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that you were happy here? Why, that
      you aspired to nothing? Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you prevent
      me from being frank in my turn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same light shone a third time in the young man&rsquo;s eyes, but died
      ineffectually away as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You distrust me,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why say you so, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for a very simple reason; if you know what you ought to know, you
      ought to mistrust everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do not be astonished that I am mistrustful, since you suspect me of
      knowing what I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance. &ldquo;Oh,
      monseigneur! you drive me to despair,&rdquo; said he, striking the armchair with
      his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, on my part, I do not comprehend you, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, try to understand me.&rdquo; The prisoner looked fixedly at Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes it seems to me,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;that I have before me the
      man whom I seek, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then your man disappears,&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo; said the prisoner,
      smiling. &ldquo;So much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis rose. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have nothing further to say to a man
      who mistrusts me as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, monsieur,&rdquo; said the prisoner, in the same tone, &ldquo;have nothing to
      say to a man who will not understand that a prisoner ought to be
      mistrustful of everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even of his old friends,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Oh, monseigneur, you are <i>too</i>
      prudent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my old friends?&mdash;you one of my old friends,&mdash;you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you no longer remember,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that you once saw, in the
      village where your early years were spent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name of the village?&rdquo; asked the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noisy-le-Sec, monseigneur,&rdquo; answered Aramis, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the young man, with an immovable aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;if you are positively resolved to carry
      on this game, let us break off. I am here to tell you many things, &lsquo;tis
      true; but you must allow me to see that, on your side, you have a desire
      to know them. Before revealing the important matters I still withhold, be
      assured I am in need of some encouragement, if not candor; a little
      sympathy, if not confidence. But you keep yourself intrenched in a
      pretended which paralyzes me. Oh, not for the reason you think; for,
      ignorant as you may be, or indifferent as you feign to be, you are none
      the less what you are, monseigneur, and there is nothing&mdash;nothing,
      mark me! which can cause you not to be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; replied the prisoner, &ldquo;to hear you without impatience.
      Only it appears to me that I have a right to repeat the question I have
      already asked, &lsquo;Who <i>are</i> you?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, fifteen or eighteen years ago, seeing at Noisy-le-Sec a
      cavalier, accompanied by a lady in black silk, with flame-colored ribbons
      in her hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;I once asked the name of this cavalier, and
      they told me that he called himself the Abbe d&rsquo;Herblay. I was astonished
      that the abbe had so warlike an air, and they replied that there was
      nothing singular in that, seeing that he was one of Louis XIII.&lsquo;s
      musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that musketeer and abbe, afterwards bishop of
      Vannes, is your confessor now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; I recognized you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, monseigneur, if you know that, I must further add a fact of which
      you are ignorant&mdash;that if the king were to know this evening of the
      presence of this musketeer, this abbe, this bishop, this confessor, <i>here</i>&mdash;he,
      who has risked everything to visit you, to-morrow would behold the steely
      glitter of the executioner&rsquo;s axe in a dungeon more gloomy, more obscure
      than yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While listening to these words, delivered with emphasis, the young man had
      raised himself on his couch, and was now gazing more and more eagerly at
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some confidence
      from it. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I remember perfectly. The woman of whom you
      speak came once with you, and twice afterwards with another.&rdquo; He
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With another, who came to see you every month&mdash;is it not so,
      monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who this lady was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light seemed ready to flash from the prisoner&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I am aware that
      she was one of the ladies of the court,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember that lady well, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my recollection can hardly be very confused on this head,&rdquo; said the
      young prisoner. &ldquo;I saw that lady once with a gentleman about forty-five
      years old. I saw her once with you, and with the lady dressed in black. I
      have seen her twice since then with the same person. These four people,
      with my master, and old Perronnette, my jailer, and the governor of the
      prison, are the only persons with whom I have ever spoken, and, indeed,
      almost the only persons I have ever seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were in prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am a prisoner here, then I was comparatively free, although in a
      very narrow sense&mdash;a house I never quitted, a garden surrounded with
      walls I could not climb, these constituted my residence, but you know it,
      as you have been there. In a word, being accustomed to live within these
      bounds, I never cared to leave them. And so you will understand, monsieur,
      that having never seen anything of the world, I have nothing left to care
      for; and therefore, if you relate anything, you will be obliged to explain
      each item to me as you go along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will do so,&rdquo; said Aramis, bowing; &ldquo;for it is my duty, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, begin by telling me who was my tutor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthy and, above all, an honorable gentleman, monseigneur; fit guide
      for both body and soul. Had you ever any reason to complain of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; quite the contrary. But this gentleman of yours often used to
      tell me that my father and mother were dead. Did he deceive me, or did he
      speak the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was compelled to comply with the orders given him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he lied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one respect. Your father is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead <i>for you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then she lives for others, does she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&mdash;and I, then&rdquo; (the young man looked sharply at Aramis) &ldquo;am
      compelled to live in the obscurity of a prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I fear so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that because my presence in the world would lead to the revelation of
      a great secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, a very great secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My enemy must indeed be powerful, to be able to shut up in the Bastile a
      child such as I then was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More powerful than my mother, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you ask that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my mother would have taken my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis hesitated. &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur; more powerful than your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing, then, that my nurse and preceptor were carried off, and that I,
      also, was separated from them&mdash;either they were, or I am, very
      dangerous to my enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you are alluding to a peril from which he freed himself, by
      causing the nurse and preceptor to disappear,&rdquo; answered Aramis, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappear!&rdquo; cried the prisoner, &ldquo;how did they disappear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a very sure way,&rdquo; answered Aramis&mdash;&ldquo;they are dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned pale, and passed his hand tremblingly over his face.
      &ldquo;Poison?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner reflected a moment. &ldquo;My enemy must indeed have been very
      cruel, or hard beset by necessity, to assassinate those two innocent
      people, my sole support; for the worthy gentleman and the poor nurse had
      never harmed a living being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your family, monseigneur, necessity is stern. And so it is necessity
      which compels me, to my great regret, to tell you that this gentleman and
      the unhappy lady have been assassinated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you tell me nothing I am not aware of,&rdquo; said the prisoner, knitting
      his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the young man, supporting himself on his two elbows, drew
      close to Aramis&rsquo;s face, with such an expression of dignity, of
      self-command and of defiance even, that the bishop felt the electricity of
      enthusiasm strike in devouring flashes from that great heart of his, into
      his brain of adamant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, monseigneur. I have already told you that by conversing with you I
      endanger my life. Little value as it has, I implore you to accept it as
      the ransom of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the young man, &ldquo;this is why I suspected they had killed my
      nurse and my preceptor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom you used to call your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; whom I called my father, but whose son I well knew I was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who caused you to suppose so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you, monsieur, are too respectful for a friend, he was also too
      respectful for a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, however,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;have no intention to disguise myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man nodded assent and continued: &ldquo;Undoubtedly, I was not
      destined to perpetual seclusion,&rdquo; said the prisoner; &ldquo;and that which makes
      me believe so, above all, now, is the care that was taken to render me as
      accomplished a cavalier as possible. The gentleman attached to my person
      taught me everything he knew himself&mdash;mathematics, a little geometry,
      astronomy, fencing and riding. Every morning I went through military
      exercises, and practiced on horseback. Well, one morning during the
      summer, it being very hot, I went to sleep in the hall. Nothing, up to
      that period, except the respect paid me, had enlightened me, or even
      roused my suspicions. I lived as children, as birds, as plants, as the air
      and the sun do. I had just turned my fifteenth year&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then, is eight years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, nearly; but I have ceased to reckon time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me; but what did your tutor tell you, to encourage you to work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He used to say that a man was bound to make for himself, in the world,
      that fortune which Heaven had refused him at his birth. He added that,
      being a poor, obscure orphan, I had no one but myself to look to; and that
      nobody either did, or ever would, take any interest in me. I was, then, in
      the hall I have spoken of, asleep from fatigue with long fencing. My
      preceptor was in his room on the first floor, just over me. Suddenly I
      heard him exclaim, and then he called: &lsquo;Perronnette! Perronnette!&rsquo; It was
      my nurse whom he called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Continue, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely she was in the garden; for my preceptor came hastily
      downstairs. I rose, anxious at seeing him anxious. He opened the
      garden-door, still crying out, &lsquo;Perronnette! Perronnette!&rsquo; The windows of
      the hall looked into the court; the shutters were closed; but through a
      chink in them I saw my tutor draw near a large well, which was almost
      directly under the windows of his study. He stooped over the brim, looked
      into the well, and again cried out, and made wild and affrighted gestures.
      Where I was, I could not only see, but hear&mdash;and see and hear I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, I pray you,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dame Perronnette came running up, hearing the governor&rsquo;s cries. He went
      to meet her, took her by the arm, and drew her quickly towards the edge;
      after which, as they both bent over it together, &lsquo;Look, look,&rsquo; cried he,
      &lsquo;what a misfortune!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Calm yourself, calm yourself,&rsquo; said Perronnette; &lsquo;what is the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The letter!&rsquo; he exclaimed; &lsquo;do you see that letter?&rsquo; pointing to the
      bottom of the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What letter?&rsquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The letter you see down there; the last letter from the queen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this word I trembled. My tutor&mdash;he who passed for my father, he
      who was continually recommending me modesty and humility&mdash;in
      correspondence with the queen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The queen&rsquo;s last letter!&rsquo; cried Perronnette, without showing more
      astonishment than at seeing this letter at the bottom of the well; &lsquo;but
      how came it there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A chance, Dame Perronnette&mdash;a singular chance. I was entering my
      room, and on opening the door, the window, too, being open, a puff of air
      came suddenly and carried off this paper&mdash;this letter of her
      majesty&rsquo;s; I darted after it, and gained the window just in time to see it
      flutter a moment in the breeze and disappear down the well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Dame Perronnette; &lsquo;and if the letter has fallen into the
      well, &lsquo;tis all the same as if it was burnt; and as the queen burns all her
      letters every time she comes&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you see this lady who came every month was the queen,&rdquo; said the
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Doubtless, doubtless,&rsquo; continued the old gentleman; &lsquo;but this letter
      contained instructions&mdash;how can I follow them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Write immediately to her; give her a plain account of the accident, and
      the queen will no doubt write you another letter in place of this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! the queen would never believe the story,&rsquo; said the good gentleman,
      shaking his head; &lsquo;she will imagine that I want to keep this letter
      instead of giving it up like the rest, so as to have a hold over her. She
      is so distrustful, and M. de Mazarin so&mdash;Yon devil of an Italian is
      capable of having us poisoned at the first breath of suspicion.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis almost imperceptibly smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You know, Dame Perronnette, they are both so suspicious in all that
      concerns Philippe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philippe was the name they gave me,&rdquo; said the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, &lsquo;tis no use hesitating,&rsquo; said Dame Perronnette, &lsquo;somebody must go
      down the well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Of course; so that the person who goes down may read the paper as he is
      coming up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But let us choose some villager who cannot read, and then you will be at
      ease.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Granted; but will not any one who descends guess that a paper must be
      important for which we risk a man&rsquo;s life? However, you have given me an
      idea, Dame Perronnette; somebody shall go down the well, but that somebody
      shall be myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at this notion Dame Perronnette lamented and cried in such a manner,
      and so implored the old nobleman, with tears in her eyes, that he promised
      her to obtain a ladder long enough to reach down, while she went in search
      of some stout-hearted youth, whom she was to persuade that a jewel had
      fallen into the well, and that this jewel was wrapped in a paper. &lsquo;And as
      paper,&rsquo; remarked my preceptor, &lsquo;naturally unfolds in water, the young man
      would not be surprised at finding nothing, after all, but the letter wide
      open.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But perhaps the writing will be already effaced by that time,&rsquo; said Dame
      Perronnette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No consequence, provided we secure the letter. On returning it to the
      queen, she will see at once that we have not betrayed her; and
      consequently, as we shall not rouse the distrust of Mazarin, we shall have
      nothing to fear from him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having come to this resolution, they parted. I pushed back the shutter,
      and, seeing that my tutor was about to re-enter, I threw myself on my
      couch, in a confusion of brain caused by all I had just heard. My governor
      opened the door a few moments after, and thinking I was asleep gently
      closed it again. As soon as ever it was shut, I rose, and, listening,
      heard the sound of retiring footsteps. Then I returned to the shutters,
      and saw my tutor and Dame Perronnette go out together. I was alone in the
      house. They had hardly closed the gate before I sprang from the window and
      ran to the well. Then, just as my governor had leaned over, so leaned I.
      Something white and luminous glistened in the green and quivering silence
      of the water. The brilliant disk fascinated and allured me; my eyes became
      fixed, and I could hardly breathe. The well seemed to draw me downwards
      with its slimy mouth and icy breath; and I thought I read, at the bottom
      of the water, characters of fire traced upon the letter the queen had
      touched. Then, scarcely knowing what I was about, and urged on by one of
      those instinctive impulses which drive men to destruction, I lowered the
      cord from the windlass of the well to within about three feet of the
      water, leaving the bucket dangling, at the same time taking infinite pains
      not to disturb that coveted letter, which was beginning to change its
      white tint for the hue of chrysoprase,&mdash;proof enough that it was
      sinking,&mdash;and then, with the rope weltering in my hands, slid down
      into the abyss. When I saw myself hanging over the dark pool, when I saw
      the sky lessening above my head, a cold shudder came over me, a chill fear
      got the better of me, I was seized with giddiness, and the hair rose on my
      head; but my strong will still reigned supreme over all the terror and
      disquietude. I gained the water, and at once plunged into it, holding on
      by one hand, while I immersed the other and seized the dear letter, which,
      alas! came in two in my grasp. I concealed the two fragments in my
      body-coat, and, helping myself with my feet against the sides of the pit,
      and clinging on with my hands, agile and vigorous as I was, and, above
      all, pressed for time, I regained the brink, drenching it as I touched it
      with the water that streamed off me. I was no sooner out of the well with
      my prize, than I rushed into the sunlight, and took refuge in a kind of
      shrubbery at the bottom of the garden. As I entered my hiding-place, the
      bell which resounded when the great gate was opened, rang. It was my
      preceptor come back again. I had but just time. I calculated that it would
      take ten minutes before he would gain my place of concealment, even if,
      guessing where I was, he came straight to it; and twenty if he were
      obliged to look for me. But this was time enough to allow me to read the
      cherished letter, whose fragments I hastened to unite again. The writing
      was already fading, but I managed to decipher it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?&rdquo; asked Aramis,
      deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite enough, monsieur, to see that my tutor was a man of noble rank, and
      that Perronnette, without being a lady of quality, was far better than a
      servant; and also to perceived that I must myself be high-born, since the
      queen, Anne of Austria, and Mazarin, the prime minister, commended me so
      earnestly to their care.&rdquo; Here the young man paused, quite overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened?&rdquo; asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened, monsieur,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;that the workmen they had summoned
      found nothing in the well, after the closest search; that my governor
      perceived that the brink was all watery; that I was not so dried by the
      sun as to prevent Dame Perronnette spying that my garments were moist;
      and, lastly, that I was seized with a violent fever, owing to the chill
      and the excitement of my discovery, an attack of delirium supervening,
      during which I related the whole adventure; so that, guided by my avowal,
      my governor found the pieces of the queen&rsquo;s letter inside the bolster
      where I had concealed them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;now I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond this, all is conjecture. Doubtless the unfortunate lady and
      gentleman, not daring to keep the occurrence secret, wrote of all this to
      the queen and sent back the torn letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After which,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;you were arrested and removed to the
      Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your two attendants disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us not take up our time with the dead, but see what can be done with
      the living. You told me you were resigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without any desire for freedom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without ambition, sorrow, or thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Aramis, &ldquo;why are you silent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have spoken enough,&rdquo; answered the prisoner, &ldquo;and that now it is
      your turn. I am weary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis gathered himself up, and a shade of deep solemnity spread itself
      over his countenance. It was evident that he had reached the crisis in the
      part he had come to the prison to play. &ldquo;One question,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the house you inhabited there were neither looking-glasses nor
      mirrors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are those two words, and what is their meaning?&rdquo; asked the young
      man; &ldquo;I have no sort of knowledge of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They designate two pieces of furniture which reflect objects; so that,
      for instance, you may see in them your own lineaments, as you see mine
      now, with the naked eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; there was neither a glass nor a mirror in the house,&rdquo; answered the
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked round him. &ldquo;Nor is there anything of the kind here, either,&rdquo;
       he said; &ldquo;they have again taken the same precaution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know directly. Now, you have told me that you were instructed in
      mathematics, astronomy, fencing, and riding; but you have not said a word
      about history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My tutor sometimes related to me the principal deeds of the king, St.
      Louis, King Francis I., and King Henry IV.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This also was done by design, then; just as they deprived you of mirrors,
      which reflect the present, so they left you in ignorance of history, which
      reflects the past. Since your imprisonment, books have been forbidden you;
      so that you are unacquainted with a number of facts, by means of which you
      would be able to reconstruct the shattered mansion of your recollections
      and your hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, then; I will in a few words tell you what has passed in France
      during the last twenty-three or twenty-four years; that is, from the
      probable date of your birth; in a word, from the time that interests you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say on.&rdquo; And the young man resumed his serious and attentive attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who was the son of Henry IV.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I know who his successor was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By means of a coin dated 1610, which bears the effigy of Henry IV.; and
      another of 1612, bearing that of Louis XIII. So I presumed that, there
      being only two years between the two dates, Louis was Henry&rsquo;s successor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;you know that the last reigning monarch was Louis
      XIII.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered the youth, slightly reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he was a prince full of noble ideas and great projects, always,
      alas! deferred by the trouble of the times and the dread struggle that his
      minister Richelieu had to maintain against the great nobles of France. The
      king himself was of a feeble character, and died young and unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had been long anxious about having a heir; a care which weighs heavily
      on princes, who desire to leave behind them more than one pledge that
      their best thoughts and works will be continued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the king, then, die childless?&rdquo; asked the prisoner, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he was long without one, and for a long while thought he should
      be the last of his race. This idea had reduced him to the depths of
      despair, when suddenly, his wife, Anne of Austria&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that Louis XIII.&lsquo;s wife was called Anne of
      Austria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; said the young man, without replying to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When suddenly,&rdquo; resumed Aramis, &ldquo;the queen announced an interesting
      event. There was great joy at the intelligence, and all prayed for her
      happy delivery. On the 5th of September, 1638, she gave birth to a son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Aramis looked at his companion, and thought he observed him turning
      pale. &ldquo;You are about to hear,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;an account which few indeed
      could now avouch; for it refers to a secret which they imagined buried
      with the dead, entombed in the abyss of the confessional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will tell me this secret?&rdquo; broke in the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Aramis, with unmistakable emphasis, &ldquo;I do not know that I ought
      to risk this secret by intrusting it to one who has no desire to quit the
      Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen, then, gave birth to a son. But while the court was rejoicing
      over the event, when the king had shown the new-born child to the nobility
      and people, and was sitting gayly down to table, to celebrate the event,
      the queen, who was alone in her room, was again taken ill and gave birth
      to a second son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the prisoner, betraying a better acquaintance with affairs than
      he had owned to, &ldquo;I thought that Monsieur was only born in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis raised his finger; &ldquo;Permit me to continue,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner sighed impatiently, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;the queen had a second son, whom Dame Perronnette,
      the midwife, received in her arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dame Perronnette!&rdquo; murmured the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ran at once to the banqueting-room, and whispered to the king what
      had happened; he rose and quitted the table. But this time it was no
      longer happiness that his face expressed, but something akin to terror.
      The birth of twins changed into bitterness the joy to which that of an
      only son had given rise, seeing that in France (a fact you are assuredly
      ignorant of) it is the oldest of the king&rsquo;s sons who succeeds his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that the doctors and jurists assert that there is ground for doubting
      whether the son that first makes his appearance is the elder by the law of
      heaven and of nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner uttered a smothered cry, and became whiter than the coverlet
      under which he hid himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you understand,&rdquo; pursued Aramis, &ldquo;that the king, who with so much
      pleasure saw himself repeated in one, was in despair about two; fearing
      that the second might dispute the first&rsquo;s claim to seniority, which had
      been recognized only two hours before; and so this second son, relying on
      party interests and caprices, might one day sow discord and engender civil
      war throughout the kingdom; by these means destroying the very dynasty he
      should have strengthened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand!&mdash;I understand!&rdquo; murmured the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Aramis; &ldquo;this is what they relate, what they declare;
      this is why one of the queen&rsquo;s two sons, shamefully parted from his
      brother, shamefully sequestered, is buried in profound obscurity; this is
      why that second son has disappeared, and so completely, that not a soul in
      France, save his mother, is aware of his existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! his mother, who has cast him off,&rdquo; cried the prisoner in a tone of
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except, also,&rdquo; Aramis went on, &ldquo;the lady in the black dress; and,
      finally, excepting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excepting yourself&mdash;is it not? You who come and relate all this;
      you, who rouse in my soul curiosity, hatred, ambition, and, perhaps, even
      the thirst of vengeance; except you, monsieur, who, if you are the man to
      whom I expect, whom the note I have received applies to, whom, in short,
      Heaven ought to send me, must possess about you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A portrait of the king, Louis XIV., who at this moment reigns upon the
      throne of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the portrait,&rdquo; replied the bishop, handing the prisoner a
      miniature in enamel, on which Louis was depicted life-like, with a
      handsome, lofty mien. The prisoner eagerly seized the portrait, and gazed
      at it with devouring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;here is a mirror.&rdquo; Aramis left the
      prisoner time to recover his ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So high!&mdash;so high!&rdquo; murmured the young man, eagerly comparing the
      likeness of Louis with his own countenance reflected in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; at length said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I am lost,&rdquo; replied the captive; &ldquo;the king will never set me
      free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&mdash;I demand to know,&rdquo; added the bishop, fixing his piercing eyes
      significantly upon the prisoner, &ldquo;I demand to know which of these two is
      king; the one this miniature portrays, or whom the glass reflects?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king, monsieur,&rdquo; sadly replied the young man, &ldquo;is he who is on the
      throne, who is not in prison; and who, on the other hand, can cause others
      to be entombed there. Royalty means power; and you behold how powerless I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; answered Aramis, with a respect he had not yet manifested,
      &ldquo;the king, mark me, will, if you desire it, be the one that, quitting his
      dungeon, shall maintain himself upon the throne, on which his friends will
      place him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempt me not, monsieur,&rdquo; broke in the prisoner bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not weak, monseigneur,&rdquo; persisted Aramis; &ldquo;I have brought you all the
      proofs of your birth; consult them; satisfy yourself that you are a king&rsquo;s
      son; it is for <i>us</i> to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; it is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless, indeed,&rdquo; resumed the bishop ironically, &ldquo;it be the destiny of
      your race, that the brothers excluded from the throne should be always
      princes void of courage and honesty, as was your uncle, M. Gaston
      d&rsquo;Orleans, who ten times conspired against his brother Louis XIII.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the prince, astonished; &ldquo;my uncle Gaston &lsquo;conspired against
      his brother&rsquo;; conspired to dethrone him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, monseigneur; for no other reason. I tell you the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he had friends&mdash;devoted friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much so as I am to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, after all, what did he do?&mdash;Failed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He failed, I admit; but always through his own fault; and, for the sake
      of purchasing&mdash;not his life&mdash;for the life of the king&rsquo;s brother
      is sacred and inviolable&mdash;but his liberty, he sacrificed the lives of
      all his friends, one after another. And so, at this day, he is a very blot
      on history, the detestation of a hundred noble families in this kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, monsieur; either by weakness or treachery, my uncle slew
      his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By weakness; which, in princes, is always treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cannot a man fail, then, from incapacity and ignorance? Do you really
      believe it possible that a poor captive such as I, brought up, not only at
      a distance from the court, but even from the world&mdash;do you believe it
      possible that such a one could assist those of his friends who should
      attempt to serve him?&rdquo; And as Aramis was about to reply, the young man
      suddenly cried out, with a violence which betrayed the temper of his
      blood, &ldquo;We are speaking of friends; but how can <i>I</i> have any friends&mdash;I,
      whom no one knows; and have neither liberty, money, nor influence, to gain
      any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy I had the honor to offer myself to your royal highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not style me so, monsieur; &lsquo;tis either treachery or cruelty. Bid
      me not think of aught beyond these prison-walls, which so grimly confine
      me; let me again love, or, at least, submit to my slavery and my
      obscurity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, monseigneur; if you again utter these desperate words&mdash;if,
      after having received proof of your high birth, you still remain
      poor-spirited in body and soul, I will comply with your desire, I will
      depart, and renounce forever the service of a master, to whom so eagerly I
      came to devote my assistance and my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; cried the prince, &ldquo;would it not have been better for you to
      have reflected, before telling me all that you have done, that you have
      broken my heart forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I desire to do, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk to me about power, grandeur, eye, and to prate of thrones! Is a
      prison the fit place? You wish to make me believe in splendor, and we are
      lying lost in night; you boast of glory, and we are smothering our words
      in the curtains of this miserable bed; you give me glimpses of power
      absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer in the
      corridor&mdash;that step which, after all, makes you tremble more than it
      does me. To render me somewhat less incredulous, free me from the Bastile;
      let me breathe the fresh air; give me my spurs and trusty sword, then we
      shall begin to understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is precisely my intention to give you all this, monseigneur, and more;
      only, do you desire it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word more,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I know there are guards in every gallery,
      bolts to every door, cannon and soldiery at every barrier. How will you
      overcome the sentries&mdash;spike the guns? How will you break through the
      bolts and bars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&mdash;how did you get the note which announced my arrival to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can corrupt one turnkey, we can corrupt ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from the
      Bastile; possible so to conceal him that the king&rsquo;s people shall not again
      ensnare him; possible, in some unknown retreat, to sustain the unhappy
      wretch in some suitable manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; said Aramis, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit that, whoever would do this much for me, would seem more than
      mortal in my eyes; but as you tell me I am a prince, brother of the king,
      how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my brother
      have deprived me of? And as, to effect this, I must pass a life of war and
      hatred, how can you cause me to prevail in those combats&mdash;render me
      invulnerable by my enemies? Ah! monsieur, reflect on all this; place me,
      to-morrow, in some dark cavern at a mountain&rsquo;s base; yield me the delight
      of hearing in freedom sounds of the river, plain and valley, of beholding
      in freedom the sun of the blue heavens, or the stormy sky, and it is
      enough. Promise me no more than this, for, indeed, more you cannot give,
      and it would be a crime to deceive me, since you call yourself my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis waited in silence. &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he resumed, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection, &ldquo;I admire the firm, sound sense which dictates your words; I
      am happy to have discovered my monarch&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, again! oh, God! for mercy&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; cried the prince, pressing his
      icy hands upon his clammy brow, &ldquo;do not play with me! I have no need to be
      a king to be the happiest of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I, monseigneur, wish you to be a king for the good of humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the prince, with fresh distrust inspired by the word; &ldquo;ah! with
      what, then, has humanity to reproach my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot to say, monseigneur, that if you would allow me to guide you,
      and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom, you
      will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to the
      success of your cause, and these friends are numerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Numerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less numerous than powerful, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible; I will explain, I swear before Heaven, on that day that
      I see you sitting on the throne of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall decree his fate. Do you pity him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him, who leaves me to perish in a dungeon? No, no. For him I have no
      pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have himself come to this prison, have taken me by the hand, and
      have said, &lsquo;My brother, Heaven created us to love, not to contend with one
      another. I come to you. A barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass
      your days in obscurity, far from mankind, deprived of every joy. I will
      make you sit down beside me; I will buckle round your waist our father&rsquo;s
      sword. Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or
      restrain me? Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh! never,&rsquo; I
      would have replied to him, &lsquo;I look on you as my preserver, I will respect
      you as my master. You give me far more than Heaven bestowed; for through
      you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving and being loved in this
      world.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my life! While now&mdash;now that I have guilty ones to punish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what manner, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my
      brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which
      the king ought to have heeded; I say that your mother committed a crime in
      rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature created so
      startlingly alike, of her own flesh, and I conclude that the object of
      punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By which you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That if I restore you to your place on your brother&rsquo;s throne, he shall
      take yours in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! there&rsquo;s such infinity of suffering in prison, especially it would
      be so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire; and if
      it seems good to you, after punishment, you will have it in your power to
      pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, my prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the
      Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the pleasure
      of seeing you once again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! how will you give me notice of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By myself coming to fetch you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My prince, do not leave this chamber save with me, or if in my absence
      you are compelled to do so, remember that I am not concerned in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever, save to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save only to me.&rdquo; Aramis bowed very low. The prince offered his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that issued from his heart, &ldquo;one word more,
      my last. If you have sought me for my destruction; if you are only a tool
      in the hands of my enemies; if from our conference, in which you have
      sounded the depths of my mind, anything worse than captivity result, that
      is to say, if death befall me, still receive my blessing, for you will
      have ended my troubles and given me repose from the tormenting fever that
      has preyed on me for eight long, weary years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, wait the results ere you judge me,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that, in such a case, I bless and forgive you. If, on the other
      hand, you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of
      fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven; if by your means I am
      enabled to live in the memory of man, and confer luster on my race by
      deeds of valor, or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people; if, from my
      present depths of sorrow, aided by your generous hand, I raise myself to
      the very height of honor, then to you, whom I thank with blessings, to you
      will I offer half my power and my glory: though you would still be but
      partly recompensed, and your share must always remain incomplete, since I
      could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Aramis, moved by the pallor and excitement of the
      young man, &ldquo;the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and admiration.
      It is not you who will have to thank me, but rather the nation whom you
      will render happy, the posterity whose name you will make glorious. Yes; I
      shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than life, I shall have given you
      immortality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince offered his hand to Aramis, who sank upon his knee and kissed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the first act of homage paid to our future king,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When I
      see you again, I shall say, &lsquo;Good day, sire.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till then,&rdquo; said the young man, pressing his wan and wasted fingers over
      his heart,&mdash;&ldquo;till then, no more dreams, no more strain on my life&mdash;my
      heart would break! Oh, monsieur, how small is my prison&mdash;how low the
      window&mdash;how narrow are the doors! To think that so much pride,
      splendor, and happiness, should be able to enter in and to remain here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royal highness makes me proud,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;since you infer it is
      I who brought all this.&rdquo; And he rapped immediately on the door. The jailer
      came to open it with Baisemeaux, who, devoured by fear and uneasiness, was
      beginning, in spite of himself, to listen at the door. Happily, neither of
      the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice, even in the most
      passionate outbreaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a confessor!&rdquo; said the governor, forcing a laugh; &ldquo;who would believe
      that a compulsory recluse, a man as though in the very jaws of death,
      could have committed crimes so numerous, and so long to tell of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis made no reply. He was eager to leave the Bastile, where the secret
      which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls. As soon as
      they reached Baisemeaux&rsquo;s quarters, &ldquo;Let us proceed to business, my dear
      governor,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand
      livres,&rdquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to pay over the first third of the sum,&rdquo; added the poor governor,
      with a sigh, taking three steps towards his iron strong-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the receipt,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here is the money,&rdquo; returned Baisemeaux, with a threefold sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The order instructed me only to give a receipt; it said nothing about
      receiving the money,&rdquo; rejoined Aramis. &ldquo;Adieu, monsieur le governeur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he departed, leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with joy and
      surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the confessor
      extraordinary to the Bastile.

      Chapter II. How Mouston Had Become Fatter without Giving Porthos Notice
      Thereof, and of the Troubles Which Consequently Befell that Worthy
      Gentleman.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the departure of Athos for Blois, Porthos and D&rsquo;Artagnan were seldom
      together. One was occupied with harassing duties for the king, the other
      had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended to forward
      to his estate, and by aid of which he hoped to establish in his various
      residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed in all its
      dazzling brightness in his majesty&rsquo;s society. D&rsquo;Artagnan, ever faithful,
      one morning during an interval of service thought about Porthos, and being
      uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a fortnight, directed his
      steps towards his hotel, and pounced upon him just as he was getting up.
      The worthy baron had a pensive&mdash;nay, more than pensive&mdash;melancholy
      air. He was sitting on his bed, only half-dressed, and with legs dangling
      over the edge, contemplating a host of garments, which with their fringes,
      lace, embroidery, and slashes of ill-assorted hues, were strewed all over
      the floor. Porthos, sad and reflective as La Fontaine&rsquo;s hare, did not
      observe D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s entrance, which was, moreover, screened at this
      moment by M. Mouston, whose personal corpulency, quite enough at any time
      to hide one man from another, was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat
      which the intendant was holding up for his master&rsquo;s inspection, by the
      sleeves, that he might the better see it all over. D&rsquo;Artagnan stopped at
      the threshold and looked in at the pensive Porthos and then, as the sight
      of the innumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to
      heave the bosom of that excellent gentleman, D&rsquo;Artagnan thought it time to
      put an end to these dismal reflections, and coughed by way of announcing
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Porthos, whose countenance brightened with joy; &ldquo;ah! ah!
      Here is D&rsquo;Artagnan. I shall then get hold of an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Mouston, doubting what was going on behind him, got out of
      the way, smiling kindly at the friend of his master, who thus found
      himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented his reaching
      D&rsquo;Artagnan. Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in rising, and
      crossing the room in two strides, found himself face to face with his
      friend, whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection that seemed
      to increase with every day. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;you are always welcome,
      dear friend; but just now you are more welcome than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you seem to have the megrims here!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos replied by a look expressive of dejection. &ldquo;Well, then, tell me
      all about it, Porthos, my friend, unless it is a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; returned Porthos, &ldquo;you know I have no secrets from
      you. This, then, is what saddens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, Porthos; let me first get rid of all this litter of satin
      and velvet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind,&rdquo; said Porthos, contemptuously; &ldquo;it is all trash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trash, Porthos! Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell! gorgeous satin! regal
      velvet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think these clothes are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid, Porthos, splendid! I&rsquo;ll wager that you alone in France have so
      many; and suppose you never had any more made, and were to live to be a
      hundred years of age, which wouldn&rsquo;t astonish me in the very least, you
      could still wear a new dress the day of your death, without being obliged
      to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my friend,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;this unnatural melancholy in you
      frightens me. My dear Porthos, pray get it out, then. And the sooner the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend, so I will: if, indeed, it is possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: they have felled the wood, and it has yielded a third more than the
      estimate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend: they have been fished, and there is enough left to stock
      all the pools in the neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend; on the contrary, the ground was struck with lightning a
      hundred paces from the chateau, and a fountain sprung up in a place
      entirely destitute of water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world <i>is</i> the matter, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, I have received an invitation for the <i>fete</i> at Vaux,&rdquo;
       said Porthos, with a lugubrious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! do you complain of that? The king has caused a hundred mortal
      heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations. And so, my
      dear friend, you are really going to Vaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see a magnificent sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I doubt it, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Porthos, tearing out a lock of hair in his despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! good heavens, are you ill?&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf! It isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis that I have no clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan stood petrified. &ldquo;No clothes! Porthos, no clothes!&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;when I see at least fifty suits on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty, truly; but not one which fits me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? not one that fits you? But are you not measured, then, when you
      give an order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he is,&rdquo; answered Mouston; &ldquo;but unfortunately <i>I</i> have
      gotten stouter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! <i>you</i> stouter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much so that I am now bigger than the baron. Would you believe it,
      monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> it seems to me that is quite evident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see, stupid?&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;that is quite evident!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, my dear Porthos,&rdquo; resumed D&rsquo;Artagnan, becoming slightly
      impatient, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why your clothes should not fit you,
      because Mouston has grown stouter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to explain it,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;You remember having related to
      me the story of the Roman general Antony, who had always seven wild boars
      kept roasting, each cooked up to a different point; so that he might be
      able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it.
      Well, then, I resolved, as at any time I might be invited to court to
      spend a week, I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the
      occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capitally reasoned, Porthos&mdash;only a man must have a fortune like
      yours to gratify such whims. Without counting the time lost in being
      measured, the fashions are always changing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the point,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;in regard to which I flattered
      myself I had hit on a very ingenious device.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what it is; for I don&rsquo;t doubt your genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember what Mouston once was, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; when he used to call himself Mousqueton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly. I beg your pardon, my good Mouston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are not in fault, monsieur,&rdquo; said Mouston, graciously. &ldquo;You were
      in Paris, and as for us, we were at Pierrefonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my dear Porthos; there was a time when Mouston began to grow
      fat. Is that what you wished to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend; and I greatly rejoice over the period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I believe you do,&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; continued Porthos, &ldquo;what a world of trouble it spared
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;by any means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my friend. In the first place, as you have said, to be
      measured is a loss of time, even though it occur only once a fortnight.
      And then, one may be travelling; and then you wish to have seven suits
      always with you. In short, I have a horror of letting any one take my
      measure. Confound it! either one is a nobleman or not. To be scrutinized
      and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you, by inch and line&mdash;&lsquo;tis
      degrading! Here, they find you too hollow; there, too prominent. They
      recognize your strong and weak points. See, now, when we leave the
      measurer&rsquo;s hands, we are like those strongholds whose angles and different
      thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, my dear Porthos, you possess ideas entirely original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you see when a man is an engineer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has fortified Belle-Isle&mdash;&lsquo;tis natural, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had an idea, which would doubtless have proved a good one, but
      for Mouston&rsquo;s carelessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan glanced at Mouston, who replied by a slight movement of his
      body, as if to say, &ldquo;You will see whether I am at all to blame in all
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulated myself, then,&rdquo; resumed Porthos, &ldquo;at seeing Mouston get
      fat; and I did all I could, by means of substantial feeding, to make him
      stout&mdash;always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in
      girth, and could then be measured in my stead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;I see&mdash;that spared you both time and
      humiliation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider my joy when, after a year and a half&rsquo;s judicious feeding&mdash;for
      I used to feed him up myself&mdash;the fellow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I lent a good hand myself, monsieur,&rdquo; said Mouston, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Consider my joy when, one morning, I perceived Mouston was
      obliged to squeeze in, as I once did myself, to get through the little
      secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of the
      late Madame du Vallon, in the chateau of Pierrefonds. And, by the way,
      about that door, my friend, I should like to ask you, who know everything,
      why these wretches of architects, who ought to have the compasses run into
      them, just to remind them, came to make doorways through which nobody but
      thin people can pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those doors,&rdquo; answered D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;were meant for gallants, and they
      have generally slight and slender figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame du Vallon had no gallant!&rdquo; answered Porthos, majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true, my friend,&rdquo; resumed D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;but the architects were
      probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of your
      marrying again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is possible,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;And now I have received an
      explanation of how it is that doorways are made too narrow, let us return
      to the subject of Mouston&rsquo;s fatness. But see how the two things apply to
      each other. I have always noticed that people&rsquo;s ideas run parallel. And
      so, observe this phenomenon, D&rsquo;Artagnan. I was talking to you of Mouston,
      who is fat, and it led us on to Madame du Vallon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was thin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Is it not marvelous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, a <i>savant</i> of my acquaintance, M. Costar, has made
      the same observation as you have, and he calls the process by some Greek
      name which I forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! my remark is not then original?&rdquo; cried Porthos, astounded. &ldquo;I
      thought I was the discoverer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, the fact was known before Aristotle&rsquo;s days&mdash;that is to
      say, nearly two thousand years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, &lsquo;tis no less true,&rdquo; said Porthos, delighted at the idea of
      having jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest
      sages of antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderfully&mdash;but suppose we return to Mouston. It seems to me, we
      have left him fattening under our very eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; said Mouston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;Mouston fattened so well, that he gratified all my
      hopes, by reaching my standard; a fact of which I was well able to
      convince myself, by seeing the rascal, one day, in a waistcoat of mine,
      which he had turned into a coat&mdash;a waistcoat, the mere embroidery of
      which was worth a hundred pistoles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas only to try it on, monsieur,&rdquo; said Mouston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my
      tailors, and to have him measured instead of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A capital idea, Porthos; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! They measured him down to the ground, and the end of the skirt
      came just below my knee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a marvelous man you are, Porthos! Such a thing could happen only to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes; pay your compliments; you have ample grounds to go upon. It was
      exactly at that time&mdash;that is to say, nearly two years and a half ago&mdash;that
      I set out for Belle-Isle, instructing Mouston (so as always to have, in
      every event, a pattern of every fashion) to have a coat made for himself
      every month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions? Ah! that was
      anything but right, Mouston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, quite the contrary; quite the contrary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he never forgot to have his coats made; but he forgot to inform me
      that he had got stouter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was not my fault, monsieur! your tailor never told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this to such an extent, monsieur,&rdquo; continued Porthos, &ldquo;that the
      fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth, and so my last
      dozen coats are all too large, from a foot to a foot and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the rest; those which were made when you were of the same size?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are no longer the fashion, my dear friend. Were I to put them on, I
      should look like a fresh arrival from Siam; and as though I had been two
      years away from court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your difficulty. You have how many new suits? nine?
      thirty-six? and yet not one to wear. Well, you must have a thirty-seventh
      made, and give the thirty-six to Mouston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur!&rdquo; said Mouston, with a gratified air. &ldquo;The truth is, that
      monsieur has always been very generous to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insinuate that I hadn&rsquo;t that idea, or that I was deterred
      by the expense? But it wants only two days to the <i>fete</i>; I received
      the invitation yesterday; made Mouston post hither with my wardrobe, and
      only this morning discovered my misfortune; and from now till the day
      after to-morrow, there isn&rsquo;t a single fashionable tailor who will
      undertake to make me a suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, one covered all over with gold, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it so! undoubtedly, all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we shall manage it. You won&rsquo;t leave for three days. The invitations
      are for Wednesday, and this is only Sunday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis true; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four
      hours beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was Aramis who brought me the invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! to be sure, I see. You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means! by the king, dear friend. The letter bears the following as
      large as life: &lsquo;M. le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has
      condescended to place him on the invitation list&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but you leave with M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I think,&rdquo; cried Porthos, stamping on the floor, &ldquo;when I think I
      shall have no clothes, I am ready to burst with rage! I should like to
      strangle somebody or smash something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither strangle anybody nor smash anything, Porthos; I will manage it
      all; put on one of your thirty-six suits, and come with me to a tailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! my agent has seen them all this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even M. Percerin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is M. Percerin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! only the king&rsquo;s tailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ah, yes,&rdquo; said Porthos, who wished to appear to know the king&rsquo;s
      tailor, but now heard his name mentioned for the first time; &ldquo;to M.
      Percerin&rsquo;s, by Jove! I was afraid he would be too busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless he will be; but be at ease, Porthos; he will do for me what he
      wouldn&rsquo;t do for another. Only you must allow yourself to be measured!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Porthos, with a sigh, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis vexatious, but what would you have
      me do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? As others do; as the king does.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;The king is a beau, my good friend, and so are you, too, whatever you may
      say about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos smiled triumphantly. &ldquo;Let us go to the king&rsquo;s tailor,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;and since he measures the king, I think, by my faith, I may do worse than
      allow him to measure <i>me!</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter III. Who Messire Jean Percerin Was.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s tailor, Messire Jean Percerin, occupied a rather large house in
      the Rue St. Honore, near the Rue de l&rsquo;Arbre Sec. He was a man of great
      taste in elegant stuffs, embroideries, and velvets, being hereditary
      tailor to the king. The preferment of his house reached as far back as the
      time of Charles IX.; from whose reign dated, as we know, fancy in <i>bravery</i>
      difficult enough to gratify. The Percerin of that period was a Huguenot,
      like Ambrose Pare, and had been spared by the Queen of Navarre, the
      beautiful Margot, as they used to write and say, too, in those days;
      because, in sooth, he was the only one who could make for her those
      wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to wear, seeing that they were
      marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical defects, which the
      Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal. Percerin being saved,
      made, out of gratitude, some beautiful black bodices, very inexpensively
      indeed, for Queen Catherine, who ended by being pleased at the
      preservation of a Huguenot people, on whom she had long looked with
      detestation. But Percerin was a very prudent man; and having heard it said
      that there was no more dangerous sign for a Protestant than to be smiled
      up on by Catherine, and having observed that her smiles were more frequent
      than usual, he speedily turned Catholic with all his family; and having
      thus become irreproachable, attained the lofty position of master tailor
      to the Crown of France. Under Henry III., gay king as he was, this
      position was as grand as the height of one of the loftiest peaks of the
      Cordilleras. Now Percerin had been a clever man all his life, and by way
      of keeping up his reputation beyond the grave, took very good care not to
      make a bad death of it, and so contrived to die very skillfully; and that
      at the very moment he felt his powers of invention declining. He left a
      son and a daughter, both worthy of the name they were called upon to bear;
      the son, a cutter as unerring and exact as the square rule; the daughter,
      apt at embroidery, and at designing ornaments. The marriage of Henry IV.
      and Marie de Medici, and the exquisite court-mourning for the
      afore-mentioned queen, together with a few words let fall by M. de
      Bassompiere, king of the <i>beaux</i> of the period, made the fortune of
      the second generation of Percerins. M. Concino Concini, and his wife
      Galligai, who subsequently shone at the French court, sought to Italianize
      the fashion, and introduced some Florentine tailors; but Percerin, touched
      to the quick in his patriotism and his self-esteem, entirely defeated
      these foreigners, and that so well that Concino was the first to give up
      his compatriots, and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would
      never employ any other, and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day
      that Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin&rsquo;s workshop, which the
      Parisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human
      body it contained. Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown
      Percerin, the king, Louis XIII., had the generosity to bear no malice to
      his tailor, and to retain him in his service. At the time that Louis the
      Just afforded this great example of equity, Percerin had brought up two
      sons, one of whom made his <i>debut</i> at the marriage of Anne of
      Austria, invented that admirable Spanish costume, in which Richelieu
      danced a saraband, made the costumes for the tragedy of &ldquo;Mirame,&rdquo; and
      stitched on to Buckingham&rsquo;s mantle those famous pearls which were destined
      to be scattered about the pavements of the Louvre. A man becomes easily
      notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham, a M. de
      Cinq-Mars, a Mademoiselle Ninon, a M. de Beaufort, and a Marion de Lorme.
      And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory when his
      father died. This same Percerin III., old, famous and wealthy, yet further
      dressed Louis XIV.; and having no son, which was a great cause of sorrow
      to him, seeing that with himself his dynasty would end, he had brought up
      several hopeful pupils. He possessed a carriage, a country house,
      men-servants the tallest in Paris; and by special authority from Louis
      XIV., a pack of hounds. He worked for MM. de Lyonne and Letellier, under a
      sort of patronage; but politic man as he was, and versed in state secrets,
      he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert. This is beyond explanation; it
      is a matter for guessing or for intuition. Great geniuses of every kind
      live on unseen, intangible ideas; they act without themselves knowing why.
      The great Percerin (for, contrary to the rule of dynasties, it was, above
      all, the last of the Percerins who deserved the name of Great), the great
      Percerin was inspired when he cut a robe for the queen, or a coat for the
      king; he could mount a mantle for Monsieur, the clock of a stocking for
      Madame; but, in spite of his supreme talent, he could never hit off
      anything approaching a creditable fit for M. Colbert. &ldquo;That man,&rdquo; he used
      often to say, &ldquo;is beyond my art; my needle can never dot him down.&rdquo; We
      need scarcely say that Percerin was M. Fouquet&rsquo;s tailor, and that the
      superintendent highly esteemed him. M. Percerin was nearly eighty years
      old, nevertheless still fresh, and at the same time so dry, the courtiers
      used to say, that he was positively brittle. His renown and his fortune
      were great enough for M. le Prince, that king of fops, to take his arm
      when talking over the fashions; and for those least eager to pay never to
      dare to leave their accounts in arrear with him; for Master Percerin would
      for the first time make clothes upon credit, but the second never, unless
      paid for the former order.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown, instead of running
      after customers, made difficulties about obliging any fresh ones. And so
      Percerin declined to fit <i>bourgeois</i>, or those who had but recently
      obtained patents of nobility. A story used to circulate that even M. de
      Mazarin, in exchange for Percerin supplying him with a full suit of
      ceremonial vestments as cardinal, one fine day slipped letters of nobility
      into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D&rsquo;Artagnan took
      the despairing Porthos; who, as they were going along, said to his friend,
      &ldquo;Take care, my good D&rsquo;Artagnan, not to compromise the dignity of a man
      such as I am with the arrogance of this Percerin, who will, I expect, be
      very impertinent; for I give you notice, my friend, that if he is wanting
      in respect I will infallibly chastise him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presented by me,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you have nothing to fear, even
      though you were what you are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! &lsquo;tis because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Have you anything against Percerin, Porthos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow refused to supply me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a misunderstanding, no doubt, which it will be now exceedingly easy
      to set right. Mouston must have made a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has confused the names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. That rascal Mouston never can remember names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take it all upon myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop the carriage, Porthos; here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! how here? We are at the Halles; and you told me the house was at
      the corner of the Rue de l&rsquo;Arbre Sec.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis true, but look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do look, and I see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> that we are at the Halles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the
      carriage in front of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of
      it. Nor that the second should be driven over the roofs of the thirty or
      forty others which have arrived before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are right, indeed. What a number of people! And what are they all
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis very simple. They are waiting their turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Have the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne shifted their
      quarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are going to wait too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down, pass through the footmen and lackeys, and enter the tailor&rsquo;s
      house, which I will answer for our doing, if you go first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly alighted and made their way on foot towards the
      establishment. The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin&rsquo;s doors
      were closed, while a servant, standing before them, was explaining to the
      illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M. Percerin
      could not receive anybody. It was bruited about outside still, on the
      authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom he
      favored, in confidence, that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes for
      the king, and that, owing to the urgency of the case, he was meditating in
      his office on the ornaments, colors, and cut of these five suits. Some,
      contented with this reason, went away again, contented to repeat the tale
      to others, but others, more tenacious, insisted on having the doors
      opened, and among these last three Blue Ribbons, intended to take parts in
      a ballet, which would inevitably fail unless the said three had their
      costumes shaped by the very hand of the great Percerin himself.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, pushing on Porthos, who scattered the groups of people right
      and left, succeeded in gaining the counter, behind which the journeyman
      tailors were doing their best to answer queries. (We forgot to mention
      that at the door they wanted to put off Porthos like the rest, but
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, showing himself, pronounced merely these words, &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s
      order,&rdquo; and was let in with his friend.) The poor fellows had enough to
      do, and did their best, to reply to the demands of the customers in the
      absence of their master, leaving off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence;
      and when wounded pride, or disappointed expectation, brought down upon
      them too cutting a rebuke, he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared
      under the counter. The line of discontented lords formed a truly
      remarkable picture. Our captain of musketeers, a man of sure and rapid
      observation, took it all in at a glance; and having run over the groups,
      his eye rested on a man in front of him. This man, seated upon a stool,
      scarcely showed his head above the counter that sheltered him. He was
      about forty years of age, with a melancholy aspect, pale face, and soft
      luminous eyes. He was looking at D&rsquo;Artagnan and the rest, with his chin
      resting upon his hand, like a calm and inquiring amateur. Only on
      perceiving, and doubtless recognizing, our captain, he pulled his hat down
      over his eyes. It was this action, perhaps, that attracted D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s
      attention. If so, the gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an
      effect entirely different from what he had desired. In other respects his
      costume was plain, and his hair evenly cut enough for customers, who were
      not close observers, to take him for a mere tailor&rsquo;s apprentice, perched
      behind the board, and carefully stitching cloth or velvet. Nevertheless,
      this man held up his head too often to be very productively employed with
      his fingers. D&rsquo;Artagnan was not deceived,&mdash;not he; and he saw at once
      that if this man was working at anything, it certainly was not at velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; said he, addressing this man, &ldquo;and so you have become a tailor&rsquo;s
      boy, Monsieur Moliere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; replied the man, softly, &ldquo;you will make them
      recognize me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what harm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, there is no harm, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going to say there is no good in doing it either, is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! no; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;go on, Monsieur Moliere. I quite understand the interest you
      take in the plates&mdash;I will not disturb your studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But on one condition; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! willingly; in his own room. Only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that one can&rsquo;t enter it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unapproachable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For everybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody. He brought me here so that I might be at my ease to make my
      observations, and then he went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Monsieur Moliere, but you will go and tell him I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed Moliere, in the tone of a courageous dog, from which you
      snatch the bone it has legitimately gained; &ldquo;I disturb myself! Ah!
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, how hard you are upon me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here, my dear
      Moliere,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a low tone, &ldquo;I warn you of one thing: that I
      won&rsquo;t exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture, &ldquo;This gentleman, is
      it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds
      and hearts of men. The subject doubtless appeared a very promising one,
      for he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining chamber.

      Chapter IV. The Patterns.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away, leaving at
      every angle of the counter either a murmur or a menace, as the waves leave
      foam or scattered seaweed on the sands, when they retire with the ebbing
      tide. In about ten minutes Moliere reappeared, making another sign to
      D&rsquo;Artagnan from under the hangings. The latter hurried after him, with
      Porthos in the rear, and after threading a labyrinth of corridors,
      introduced him to M. Percerin&rsquo;s room. The old man, with his sleeves turned
      up, was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered brocade, so as the
      better to exhibit its luster. Perceiving D&rsquo;Artagnan, he put the silk
      aside, and came to meet him, by no means radiant with joy, and by no means
      courteous, but, take it altogether, in a tolerably civil manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain of the king&rsquo;s musketeers will excuse me, I am sure, for I am
      engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! yes, on the king&rsquo;s costumes; I know that, my dear Monsieur Percerin.
      You are making three, they tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five, my dear sir, five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or five, &lsquo;tis all the same to me, my dear monsieur; and I know that
      you will make them most exquisitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. Once made they will be the most beautiful in the world, I do
      not deny it; but that they may be the most beautiful in the word, they
      must first be made; and to do this, captain, I am pressed for time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bah! there are two days yet; &lsquo;tis much more than you require,
      Monsieur Percerin,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, in the coolest possible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percerin raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be
      contradicted, even in his whims; but D&rsquo;Artagnan did not pay the least
      attention to the airs which the illustrious tailor began to assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear M. Percerin,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I bring you a customer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Percerin, crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan.
      Percerin attempted a bow, which found no favor in the eyes of the terrible
      Porthos, who, from his first entry into the room, had been regarding the
      tailor askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good friend of mine,&rdquo; concluded D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will attend to monsieur,&rdquo; said Percerin, &ldquo;but later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later? but when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already told my valet as much,&rdquo; broke in Porthos,
      discontentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Percerin; &ldquo;I am nearly always pushed for time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; returned Porthos, sententiously, &ldquo;there is always time to be
      found when one chooses to seek it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percerin turned crimson; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Percerin,&rdquo; interposed D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you are not in a good
      temper to-day. Well, I will say one more word to you, which will bring you
      on your knees; monsieur is not only a friend of mine, but more, a friend
      of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the tailor, &ldquo;that is another thing.&rdquo; Then turning to
      Porthos, &ldquo;Monsieur le baron is attached to the superintendent?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am attached to myself,&rdquo; shouted Porthos, at the very moment that the
      tapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue. Moliere
      was all observation, D&rsquo;Artagnan laughed, Porthos swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Percerin,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you will make a dress for the baron.
      &lsquo;Tis I who ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you I will not say nay, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not all; you will make it for him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis impossible within eight days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, then, is as much as to refuse, because the dress is wanted for the
      <i>fete</i> at Vaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat that it is impossible,&rdquo; returned the obstinate old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, dear Monsieur Percerin, above all if <i>I</i> ask you,&rdquo; said
      a mild voice at the door, a silvery voice which made D&rsquo;Artagnan prick up
      his ears. It was the voice of Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay!&rdquo; cried the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis,&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! our bishop!&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, D&rsquo;Artagnan; good morning, Porthos; good-morning, my dear
      friends,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Come, come, M. Percerin, make the baron&rsquo;s dress;
      and I will answer for it you will gratify M. Fouquet.&rdquo; And he accompanied
      the words with a sign, which seemed to say, &ldquo;Agree, and dismiss them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior
      even to D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s, for the tailor bowed in assent, and turning round
      upon Porthos, said, &ldquo;Go and get measured on the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos colored in a formidable manner. D&rsquo;Artagnan saw the storm coming,
      and addressing Moliere, said to him, in an undertone, &ldquo;You see before you,
      my dear monsieur, a man who considers himself disgraced, if you measure
      the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him; study this type for me,
      Master Aristophanes, and profit by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moliere had no need of encouragement, and his gaze dwelt long and keenly
      on the Baron Porthos. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you will come with me, I
      will make them take your measure without touching you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;how do you make that out, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of your
      dress. It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of
      quality, who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch them. We
      know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured, a
      process which, as I think, wounds the natural dignity of a man; and if
      perchance monsieur should be one of these&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Corboeuf!</i> I believe I am too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence, and you shall
      have the benefit of our invention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how in the world can it be done?&rdquo; asked Porthos, delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Moliere, bowing, &ldquo;if you will deign to follow me, you
      will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes. Perhaps he fancied from
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s liveliness that he would leave with Porthos, so as not to
      lose the conclusion of a scene well begun. But, clear-sighted as he was,
      Aramis deceived himself. Porthos and Moliere left together: D&rsquo;Artagnan
      remained with Percerin. Why? From curiosity, doubtless; probably to enjoy
      a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis. As Moliere and
      Porthos disappeared, D&rsquo;Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes, a
      proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis smiled. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go to Vaux, however?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go, but without a new dress. You forget, dear D&rsquo;Artagnan, that a
      poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every <i>fete</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the musketeer, laughing, &ldquo;and do we write no more poems now,
      either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; exclaimed Aramis, &ldquo;I have long ago given up all such
      tomfoolery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; repeated D&rsquo;Artagnan, only half convinced. As for Percerin, he was
      once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you perceive,&rdquo; said Aramis, smiling, &ldquo;that we are greatly boring
      this good gentleman, my dear D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; murmured the musketeer, aside; &ldquo;that is, I am boring you, my
      friend.&rdquo; Then aloud, &ldquo;Well, then, let us leave; I have no further business
      here, and if you are as disengaged as I, Aramis&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not I&mdash;I wished&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you had something particular to say to M. Percerin? Why did you not
      tell me so at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something particular, certainly,&rdquo; repeated Aramis, &ldquo;but not for you,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan. But, at the same time, I hope you will believe that I can
      never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not
      hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no! I am going,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, imparting to his voice an
      evident tone of curiosity; for Aramis&rsquo;s annoyance, well dissembled as it
      was, had not a whit escaped him; and he knew that, in that impenetrable
      mind, every thing, even the most apparently trivial, was designed to some
      end; an unknown one, but an end that, from the knowledge he had of his
      friend&rsquo;s character, the musketeer felt must be important.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his part, Aramis saw that D&rsquo;Artagnan was not without suspicion, and
      pressed him. &ldquo;Stay, by all means,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is what it is.&rdquo; Then
      turning towards the tailor, &ldquo;My dear Percerin,&rdquo; said he,&mdash;&ldquo;I am even
      very happy that you are here, D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed the Gascon, for the third time, even less deceived
      this time than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percerin never moved. Aramis roused him violently, by snatching from his
      hands the stuff upon which he was engaged. &ldquo;My dear Percerin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
      have, near hand, M. Lebrun, one of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s painters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very good,&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;but why Lebrun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked at D&rsquo;Artagnan, who seemed to be occupied with an engraving
      of Mark Antony. &ldquo;And you wish that I should make him a dress, similar to
      those of the Epicureans?&rdquo; answered Percerin. And while saying this, in an
      absent manner, the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of
      brocade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Epicurean&rsquo;s dress?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a tone of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Aramis, with a most engaging smile, &ldquo;it is written that our
      dear D&rsquo;Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening. Yes, friend, you
      have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s Epicureans, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. Is it not a kind of poetical society, of which La Fontaine,
      Loret, Pelisson, and Moliere are members, and which holds its sittings at
      Saint-Mande?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. Well, we are going to put our poets in uniform, and enroll
      them in a regiment for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, I understand; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the
      king. Be at ease; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun, I will not
      mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always agreeable, my friend. No, Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with
      this part of it; the secret which concerns him is far more important than
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if it is so important as all that, I prefer not to know it,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, making a show of departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, M. Lebrun, come in,&rdquo; said Aramis, opening a side-door with his
      right hand, and holding back D&rsquo;Artagnan with his left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;faith, I too, am quite in the dark,&rdquo; quoth Percerin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis took an &ldquo;opportunity,&rdquo; as is said in theatrical matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear M. de Percerin,&rdquo; Aramis continued, &ldquo;you are making five dresses
      for the king, are you not? One in brocade; one in hunting-cloth; one in
      velvet; one in satin; and one in Florentine stuffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but how&mdash;do you know all that, monseigneur?&rdquo; said Percerin,
      astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very simple, my dear monsieur; there will be a hunt, a banquet,
      concert, promenade and reception; these five kinds of dress are required
      by etiquette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know everything, monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a thing or two in addition,&rdquo; muttered D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the tailor, in triumph, &ldquo;what you do not know, monseigneur&mdash;prince
      of the church though you are&mdash;what nobody will know&mdash;what only
      the king, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and myself do know, is the color of
      the materials and nature of the ornaments, and the cut, the <i>ensemble</i>,
      the finish of it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that is precisely what I have come to ask you, dear
      Percerin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; exclaimed the tailor, terrified, though Aramis had pronounced
      these words in his softest and most honeyed tones. The request appeared,
      on reflection, so exaggerated, so ridiculous, so monstrous to M. Percerin
      that first he laughed to himself, then aloud, and finished with a shout.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan followed his example, not because he found the matter so &ldquo;very
      funny,&rdquo; but in order not to allow Aramis to cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the outset, I appear to be hazarding an absurd question, do I not?&rdquo;
       said Aramis. &ldquo;But D&rsquo;Artagnan, who is incarnate wisdom itself, will tell
      you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; said the attentive musketeer; perceiving with his wonderful
      instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now, and that the hour
      of battle was approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; said Percerin, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now,&rdquo; continued Aramis, &ldquo;does M. Fouquet give the king a <i>fete?</i>&mdash;Is
      it not to please him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said Percerin. D&rsquo;Artagnan nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By delicate attentions? by some happy device? by a succession of
      surprises, like that of which we were talking?&mdash;the enrolment of our
      Epicureans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then; this is the surprise we intend. M. Lebrun here is a man who
      draws most excellently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Percerin; &ldquo;I have seen his pictures, and observed that his
      dresses were highly elaborated. That is why I at once agreed to make him a
      costume&mdash;whether to agree with those of the Epicureans, or an
      original one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear monsieur, we accept your offer, and shall presently avail
      ourselves of it; but just now, M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses you
      will make for himself, but of those you are making for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percerin made a bound backwards, which D&rsquo;Artagnan&mdash;calmest and most
      appreciative of men, did not consider overdone, so many strange and
      startling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded. &ldquo;The
      king&rsquo;s dresses! Give the king&rsquo;s dresses to any mortal whatever! Oh! for
      once, monseigneur, your grace is mad!&rdquo; cried the poor tailor in extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me now, D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said Aramis, more and more calm and smiling.
      &ldquo;Help me now to persuade monsieur, for <i>you</i> understand; do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! eh!&mdash;not exactly, I declare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king the
      surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux; and that the
      portrait, which be a striking resemblance, ought to be dressed exactly as
      the king will be on the day it is shown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, yes,&rdquo; said the musketeer, nearly convinced, so plausible was
      this reasoning. &ldquo;Yes, my dear Aramis, you are right; it is a happy idea. I
      will wager it is one of your own, Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the bishop; &ldquo;either mine or M. Fouquet&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
       Then scanning Percerin, after noticing D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;Well,
      Monsieur Percerin,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what do you say to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are, doubtless, free to refuse. I know well&mdash;and I by no
      means count upon compelling you, my dear monsieur. I will say more, I even
      understand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet&rsquo;s idea;
      you dread appearing to flatter the king. A noble spirit, M. Percerin, a
      noble spirit!&rdquo; The tailor stammered. &ldquo;It would, indeed, be a very pretty
      compliment to pay the young prince,&rdquo; continued Aramis; &ldquo;but as the
      surintendant told me, &lsquo;if Percerin refuse, tell him that it will not at
      all lower him in my opinion, and I shall always esteem him, only&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Only?&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Percerin, rather troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Only,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued Aramis, &ldquo;&lsquo;I shall be compelled to say to the king,&rsquo;&mdash;you
      understand, my dear Monsieur Percerin, that these are M. Fouquet&rsquo;s words,&mdash;&lsquo;I
      shall be constrained to say to the king, &ldquo;Sire, I had intended to present
      your majesty with your portrait, but owing to a feeling of delicacy,
      slightly exaggerated perhaps, although creditable, M. Percerin opposed the
      project.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Opposed!&rdquo; cried the tailor, terrified at the responsibility which would
      weigh upon him; &ldquo;I to oppose the desire, the will of M. Fouquet when he is
      seeking to please the king! Oh, what a hateful word you have uttered,
      monseigneur. Oppose! Oh, &lsquo;tis not I who said it, Heaven have mercy on me.
      I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it! Is it not true,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, that I have opposed nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral. He
      felt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it, whether comedy or
      tragedy; he was at his wit&rsquo;s end at not being able to fathom it, but in
      the meanwhile wished to keep clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But already Percerin, goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he
      stood in the way of a pleasant surprise, had offered Lebrun a chair, and
      proceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses, the fifth
      being still in the workmen&rsquo;s hands; and these masterpieces he successively
      fitted upon four lay figures, which, imported into France in the time of
      Concini, had been given to Percerin II. by Marshal d&rsquo;Onore, after the
      discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their competition. The
      painter set to work to draw and then to paint the dresses. But Aramis, who
      was closely watching all the phases of his toil, suddenly stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have not quite got it, my dear Lebrun,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your colors
      will deceive you, and on canvas we shall lack that exact resemblance which
      is absolutely requisite. Time is necessary for attentively observing the
      finer shades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; said Percerin, &ldquo;but time is wanting, and on that head, you
      will agree with me, monseigneur, I can do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the affair will fail,&rdquo; said Aramis, quietly, &ldquo;and that because of a
      want of precision in the colors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with the
      closest fidelity&mdash;a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world, now, is the meaning of this imbroglio?&rdquo; the musketeer
      kept saying to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will never do,&rdquo; said Aramis: &ldquo;M. Lebrun, close your box, and roll up
      your canvas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur,&rdquo; cried the vexed painter, &ldquo;the light is abominable here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idea, M. Lebrun, an idea! If we had a pattern of the materials, for
      example, and with time, and a better light&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then,&rdquo; cried Lebrun, &ldquo;I would answer for the effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;this ought to be the knotty point of the whole
      thing; they want a pattern of each of the materials. <i>Mordioux!</i> Will
      this Percerin give in now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percerin, beaten from his last retreat, and duped, moreover, by the
      feigned good-nature of Aramis, cut out five patterns and handed them to
      the bishop of Vannes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like this better. That is your opinion, is it not?&rdquo; said Aramis to
      D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Aramis,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;my opinion is that you are always the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, consequently, always your friend,&rdquo; said the bishop in a charming
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, aloud; then, in a low voice, &ldquo;If I am your
      dupe, double Jesuit that you are, I will not be your accomplice; and to
      prevent it, &lsquo;tis time I left this place.&mdash;Adieu, Aramis,&rdquo; he added
      aloud, &ldquo;adieu; I am going to rejoin Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then wait for me,&rdquo; said Aramis, pocketing the patterns, &ldquo;for I have done,
      and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes, Percerin put back the dresses
      into the closet, Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the
      patterns were secure,&mdash;and they all left the study.

    <h2>
      Chapter V. Where, Probably, Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the
      Bourgeois Gentilhomme.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber; but no longer an
      irritated Porthos, or a disappointed Porthos, but Porthos radiant,
      blooming, fascinating, and chattering with Moliere, who was looking upon
      him with a species of idolatry, and as a man would who had not only never
      seen anything greater, but not even ever anything so great. Aramis went
      straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand, which lost itself
      in the gigantic clasp of his old friend,&mdash;an operation which Aramis
      never hazarded without a certain uneasiness. But the friendly pressure
      having been performed not too painfully for him, the bishop of Vannes
      passed over to Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you come with me to Saint-Mande?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go anywhere you like, monseigneur,&rdquo; answered Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Saint-Mande!&rdquo; cried Porthos, surprised at seeing the proud bishop of
      Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor. &ldquo;What, Aramis, are you going
      to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aramis, smiling, &ldquo;our work is pressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides, my dear Porthos,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;M. Moliere is not
      altogether what he seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this gentleman is one of M. Percerin&rsquo;s chief clerks, and is expected
      at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the
      Epicureans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis precisely so,&rdquo; said Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, my dear M. Moliere,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that is, if you have done
      with M. du Vallon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have finished,&rdquo; replied Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are satisfied?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Completely so,&rdquo; replied Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony, and grasped the hand
      which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, monsieur,&rdquo; concluded Porthos, mincingly, &ldquo;above all, be exact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have your dress the day after to-morrow, monsieur le baron,&rdquo;
       answered Moliere. And he left with Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then D&rsquo;Artagnan, taking Porthos&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;What has this tailor done for you,
      my dear Porthos,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you are so pleased with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done for me, my friend! done for me!&rdquo; cried Porthos,
      enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I ask you, what has he done for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished: he has
      taken my measure without touching me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, bah! tell me how he did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, then, they went, I don&rsquo;t know where, for a number of lay figures,
      of all heights and sizes, hoping there would be one to suit mine, but the
      largest&mdash;that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard&mdash;was two
      inches too short, and a half foot too narrow in the chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exactly as I tell you, D&rsquo;Artagnan; but he is a great man, or at the
      very least a great tailor, is this M. Moliere. He was not at all put at
      fault by the circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is a very simple matter. I&rsquo;faith, &lsquo;tis an unheard-of thing that
      people should have been so stupid as not to have discovered this method
      from the first. What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to mention of the costumes, my dear Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thirty dresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Porthos, come, tell me M. Moliere&rsquo;s plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moliere? You call him so, do you? I shall make a point of recollecting
      his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; or Poquelin, if you prefer that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I like Moliere best. When I wish to recollect his name, I shall think
      of <i>voliere</i> [an aviary]; and as I have one at Pierrefonds&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; returned D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;And M. Moliere&rsquo;s plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis this: instead of pulling me to pieces, as all these rascals do&mdash;of
      making me bend my back, and double my joints&mdash;all of them low and
      dishonorable practices&mdash;&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan made a sign of approbation with
      his head. &ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; he said to me,&rdquo; continued Porthos, &ldquo;&lsquo;a gentleman
      ought to measure himself. Do me the pleasure to draw near this glass;&rsquo; and
      I drew near the glass. I must own I did not exactly understand what this
      good M. Voliere wanted with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moliere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, Moliere&mdash;Moliere. And as the fear of being measured still
      possessed me, &lsquo;Take care,&rsquo; said I to him, &lsquo;what you are going to do with
      me; I am very ticklish, I warn you.&rsquo; But he, with his soft voice (for he
      is a courteous fellow, we must admit, my friend), he with his soft voice,
      &lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that your dress may fit you well, it must be made
      according to your figure. Your figure is exactly reflected in this mirror.
      We shall take the measure of this reflection.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you saw yourself in the glass; but where did
      they find one in which you could see your whole figure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend, it is the very glass in which the king is used to look to
      see himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, I know not how that may be; it is, no doubt, a cunning way of
      flattering the king; but the looking-glass was too large for me. &lsquo;Tis true
      that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of glass, placed one
      above another, and its breadth of three similar parallelograms in
      juxtaposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Porthos! what excellent words you have command of. Where in the word
      did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Belle-Isle. Aramis and I had to use such words in our strategic
      studies and castramentative experiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan recoiled, as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked
      the breath out of his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! very good. Let us return to the looking-glass, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, this good M. Voliere&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Moliere&mdash;you are right. You will see now, my dear friend,
      that I shall recollect his name quite well. This excellent M. Moliere set
      to work tracing out lines on the mirror, with a piece of Spanish chalk,
      following in all the make of my arms and my shoulders, all the while
      expounding this maxim, which I thought admirable: &lsquo;It is advisable that a
      dress should not incommode its wearer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In reality,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;that is an excellent maxim, which is,
      unfortunately, seldom carried out in practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I found it all the more astonishing, when he expatiated upon
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he expatiated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me hear his theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Seeing that,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;one may, in awkward circumstances, or in a
      troublesome position, have one&rsquo;s doublet on one&rsquo;s shoulder, and not desire
      to take one&rsquo;s doublet off&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And so,&rsquo; continued M. Voliere&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moliere, yes. &lsquo;And so,&rsquo; went on M. Moliere, &lsquo;you want to draw your sword,
      monsieur, and you have your doublet on your back. What do you do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I take it off,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, no,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How no?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I say that the dress should be so well made, that it will in no way
      encumber you, even in drawing your sword.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, ah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Throw yourself on guard,&rsquo; pursued he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it with such wondrous firmness, that two panes of glass burst out
      of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis nothing, nothing,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Keep your position.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I raised my left arm in the air, the forearm gracefully bent, the ruffle
      drooping, and my wrist curved, while my right arm, half extended, securely
      covered my wrist with the elbow, and my breast with the wrist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the true guard&mdash;the academic guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said the very word, dear friend. In the meanwhile, Voliere&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold! I should certainly, after all, prefer to call him&mdash;what did
      you say his other name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poquelin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to call him Poquelin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how will you remember this name better than the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, he calls himself Poquelin, does he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to call to mind Madame Coquenard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And change <i>Coc</i> into <i>Poc</i>, <i>nard</i> into <i>lin</i>; and
      instead of Coquenard I shall have Poquelin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis wonderful,&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, astounded. &ldquo;Go on, my friend, I am
      listening to you with admiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Coquelin sketched my arm on the glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;Poquelin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said Coquelin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! true. This Poquelin, then, sketched my arm on the glass; but he took
      his time over it; he kept looking at me a good deal. The fact is, that I
      must have been looking particularly handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Does it weary you?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A little,&rsquo; I replied, bending a little in my hands, &lsquo;but I could hold
      out for an hour or so longer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, I will not allow it; the willing fellows will make it a duty to
      support your arms, as of old, men supported those of the prophet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That will not be humiliating to you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there is, I think, a great difference between being
      supported and being measured.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The distinction is full of the soundest sense,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Porthos, &ldquo;he made a sign: two lads approached; one
      supported my left arm, while the other, with infinite address, supported
      my right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Another, my man,&rsquo; cried he. A third approached. &lsquo;Support monsieur by the
      waist,&rsquo; said he. The <i>garcon</i> complied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you were at rest?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poquelin, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poquelin&mdash;you are right. Stay, decidedly I prefer calling him
      Voliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and then it was over, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas delicate in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I much like the plan; it is respectful, and keeps every one in his
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there it ended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a soul having touched me, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except the three <i>garcons</i> who supported you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless; but I have, I think, already explained to you the difference
      there is between supporting and measuring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis true,&rdquo; answered D&rsquo;Artagnan; who said afterwards to himself,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;faith, I greatly deceive myself, or I have been the means of a good
      windfall to that rascal Moliere, and we shall assuredly see the scene hit
      off to the life in some comedy or other.&rdquo; Porthos smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I confess? Well, I was laughing over my good fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is true; I don&rsquo;t know a happier man than you. But what is this
      last piece of luck that has befallen you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, congratulate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire nothing better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that
      manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you so sure of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly so. Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere and
      the other <i>garcons</i> showed me the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friend, that does not surprise me from Moliere,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Voliere, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, indeed! I am very willing to leave you to go on saying
      Voliere; but, as for me, I shall continued to say Moliere. Well, this, I
      was saying, does not surprise me, coming from Moliere, who is a very
      ingenious fellow, and inspired you with this grand idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be of great use to him by and by, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be of use to him, indeed? I believe you, it will, and that in
      the highest degree;&mdash;for you see my friend Moliere is of all known
      tailors the man who best clothes our barons, comtes, and marquises&mdash;according
      to their measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this observation, neither the application nor depth of which we shall
      discuss, D&rsquo;Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin&rsquo;s house and
      rejoined their carriages, wherein we will leave them, in order to look
      after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI. The Bee-Hive, the Bees, and the Honey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bishop of Vannes, much annoyed at having met D&rsquo;Artagnan at M.
      Percerin&rsquo;s, returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor. Moliere, on the
      other hand, quite delighted at having made such a capital rough sketch,
      and at knowing where to find his original again, whenever he should desire
      to convert his sketch into a picture, Moliere arrived in the merriest of
      moods. All the first story of the left wing was occupied by the most
      celebrated Epicureans in Paris, and those on the freest footing in the
      house&mdash;every one in his compartment, like the bees in their cells,
      employed in producing the honey intended for that royal cake which M.
      Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV. during the <i>fete</i> at
      Vaux. Pelisson, his head leaning on his hand, was engaged in drawing out
      the plan of the prologue to the &ldquo;Facheux,&rdquo; a comedy in three acts, which
      was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere, as D&rsquo;Artagnan called
      him, or Coquelin de Voliere, as Porthos styled him. Loret, with all the
      charming innocence of a gazetteer,&mdash;the gazetteers of all ages have
      always been so artless!&mdash;Loret was composing an account of the <i>fetes</i>
      at Vaux, before those <i>fetes</i> had taken place. La Fontaine sauntered
      about from one to the other, a peripatetic, absent-minded, boring,
      unbearable dreamer, who kept buzzing and humming at everybody&rsquo;s elbow a
      thousand poetic abstractions. He so often disturbed Pelisson, that the
      latter, raising his head, crossly said, &ldquo;At least, La Fontaine, supply me
      with a rhyme, since you have the run of the gardens at Parnassus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rhyme do you want?&rdquo; asked the <i>Fabler</i> as Madame de Sevigne
      used to call him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a rhyme to <i>lumiere</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Orniere</i>,&rdquo; answered La Fontaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but, my good friend, one cannot talk of <i>wheel-ruts</i> when
      celebrating the delights of Vaux,&rdquo; said Loret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, it doesn&rsquo;t rhyme,&rdquo; answered Pelisson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! doesn&rsquo;t rhyme!&rdquo; cried La Fontaine, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you have an abominable habit, my friend,&mdash;a habit which will
      ever prevent your becoming a poet of the first order. You rhyme in a
      slovenly manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, you think so, do you, Pelisson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, indeed. Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one can
      find a better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will never write anything again save in prose,&rdquo; said La Fontaine,
      who had taken up Pelisson&rsquo;s reproach in earnest. &ldquo;Ah! I often suspected I
      was nothing but a rascally poet! Yes, &lsquo;tis the very truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say so; your remark is too sweeping, and there is much that is
      good in your &lsquo;Fables.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to begin,&rdquo; continued La Fontaine, following up his idea, &ldquo;I will go
      and burn a hundred verses I have just made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your verses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if they are in your head you cannot burn them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said La Fontaine; &ldquo;but if I do not burn them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what will happen if you do not burn them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will remain in my mind, and I shall never forget them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; cried Loret; &ldquo;what a dangerous thing! One would go mad with
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! the deuce!&rdquo; repeated La Fontaine; &ldquo;what can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have discovered the way,&rdquo; said Moliere, who had entered just at this
      point of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write them first and burn them afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How simple! Well, I should never have discovered that. What a mind that
      devil of a Moliere has!&rdquo; said La Fontaine. Then, striking his forehead,
      &ldquo;Oh, thou wilt never be aught but an ass, Jean La Fontaine!&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> are you saying there, my friend?&rdquo; broke in Moliere,
      approaching the poet, whose aside he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say I shall never be aught but an ass,&rdquo; answered La Fontaine, with a
      heavy sigh and swimming eyes. &ldquo;Yes, my friend,&rdquo; he added, with increasing
      grief, &ldquo;it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;tis wrong to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I am a poor creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> &lsquo;twas Pelisson; did you not, Pelisson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pelisson, again absorbed in his work, took good care not to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if Pelisson said you were so,&rdquo; cried Moliere, &ldquo;Pelisson has seriously
      offended you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I advise you, as you are a gentleman, not to leave an insult like
      that unpunished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed La Fontaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once only, with a lieutenant in the light horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wrong had he done you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems he ran away with my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; said Moliere, becoming slightly pale; but as, at La Fontaine&rsquo;s
      declaration, the others had turned round, Moliere kept upon his lips the
      rallying smile which had so nearly died away, and continuing to make La
      Fontaine speak&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was the result of the duel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The result was, that on the ground my opponent disarmed me, and then made
      an apology, promising never again to set foot in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you considered yourself satisfied?&rdquo; said Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! on the contrary, I picked up my sword. &lsquo;I beg your pardon,
      monsieur,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have not fought you because you were my wife&rsquo;s
      friend, but because I was told I ought to fight. So, as I have never known
      any peace save since you made her acquaintance, do me the pleasure to
      continue your visits as heretofore, or <i>morbleu!</i> let us set to
      again.&rsquo; And so,&rdquo; continued La Fontaine, &ldquo;he was compelled to resume his
      friendship with madame, and I continue to be the happiest of husbands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All burst out laughing. Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes.
      Why? Perhaps to wipe away a tear, perhaps to smother a sigh. Alas! we know
      that Moliere was a moralist, but he was not a philosopher. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis all one,&rdquo;
       he said, returning to the topic of the conversation, &ldquo;Pelisson has
      insulted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, truly! I had already forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am going to challenge him on your behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can do so, if you think it indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think it indispensable, and I am going to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; exclaimed La Fontaine, &ldquo;I want your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon what? this insult?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; tell me really now whether <i>lumiere</i> does not rhyme with <i>orniere</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should make them rhyme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I knew you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand!&rdquo; cried La Fontaine. &ldquo;Four times as many as &lsquo;La
      Pucelle,&rsquo; which M. Chaplain is meditating. Is it also on this subject,
      too, that you have composed a hundred thousand verses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, you eternally absent-minded creature,&rdquo; said Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; continued La Fontaine, &ldquo;that <i>legume</i>, for instance,
      rhymes with <i>posthume</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the plural, above all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, above all in the plural, seeing that then it rhymes not with three
      letters, but with four; as <i>orniere</i> does with <i>lumiere</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But give me <i>ornieres</i> and <i>lumieres</i> in the plural, my dear
      Pelisson,&rdquo; said La Fontaine, clapping his hand on the shoulder of his
      friend, whose insult he had quite forgotten, &ldquo;and they will rhyme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; coughed Pelisson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moliere says so, and Moliere is a judge of such things; he declares he
      has himself made a hundred thousand verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Moliere, laughing, &ldquo;he is off now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like <i>rivage</i>, which rhymes admirably with <i>herbage</i>. I
      would take my oath of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you all this,&rdquo; continued La Fontaine, &ldquo;because you are preparing a
      <i>divertissement</i> for Vaux, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the &lsquo;Facheux.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, the &lsquo;Facheux;&rsquo; yes, I recollect. Well, I was thinking a prologue
      would admirably suit your <i>divertissement</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless it would suit capitally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are of my opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much so, that I have asked you to write this very prologue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked <i>me</i> to write it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you, and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson, who is engaged
      upon it at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is what Pelisson is doing, then? I&rsquo;faith, my dear Moliere, you
      are indeed often right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you call me absent-minded. It is a monstrous defect; I will cure
      myself of it, and do your prologue for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, true, miserable rascal that I am! Loret was indeed right in saying I
      was a poor creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not Loret who said so, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, whoever said so, &lsquo;tis the same to me! And so your <i>divertissement</i>
      is called the &lsquo;Facheux?&rsquo; Well, can you make <i>heureux</i> rhyme with <i>facheux?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If obliged, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even with <i>capriceux</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hazardous, and yet why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is too great a difference in the cadences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was fancying,&rdquo; said La Fontaine, leaving Moliere for Loret&mdash;&ldquo;I was
      fancying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you fancying?&rdquo; said Loret, in the middle of a sentence. &ldquo;Make
      haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are writing the prologue to the &lsquo;Facheux,&rsquo; are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! <i>mordieu!</i> it is Pelisson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Pelisson,&rdquo; cried La Fontaine, going over to him, &ldquo;I was fancying,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;that the nymph of Vaux&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, beautiful!&rdquo; cried Loret. &ldquo;The nymph of Vaux! thank you, La Fontaine;
      you have just given me the two concluding verses of my paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you can rhyme so well, La Fontaine,&rdquo; said Pelisson, &ldquo;tell me now
      in what way you would begin my prologue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say, for instance, &lsquo;Oh! nymph, who&mdash;&rsquo; After &lsquo;who&rsquo; I should
      place a verb in the second person singular of the present indicative; and
      should go on thus: &lsquo;this grot profound.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the verb, the verb?&rdquo; asked Pelisson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To admire the greatest king of all kings round,&rdquo; continued La Fontaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the verb, the verb,&rdquo; obstinately insisted Pelisson. &ldquo;This second
      person singular of the present indicative?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then; quittest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nymph, who quittest now this grot profound, To admire the greatest
      king of all kings round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not put &lsquo;who quittest,&rsquo; would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quittest,&rsquo; after &lsquo;you who&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear fellow,&rdquo; exclaimed La Fontaine, &ldquo;you are a shocking pedant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without counting,&rdquo; said Moliere, &ldquo;that the second verse, &lsquo;king of all
      kings round,&rsquo; is very weak, my dear La Fontaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you see clearly I am nothing but a poor creature,&mdash;a shuffler,
      as you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as Loret said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was not Loret either; it was Pelisson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pelisson was right a hundred times over. But what annoys me more
      than anything, my dear Moliere, is, that I fear we shall not have our
      Epicurean dresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expected yours, then, for the <i>fete?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for the <i>fete</i>, and then for after the <i>fete</i>. My
      housekeeper told me that my own is rather faded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i> your housekeeper is right; rather more than faded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you see,&rdquo; resumed La Fontaine, &ldquo;the fact is, I left it on the floor
      in my room, and my cat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your cat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made her nest upon it, which has rather changed its color.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moliere burst out laughing; Pelisson and Loret followed his example. At
      this juncture, the bishop of Vannes appeared, with a roll of plans and
      parchments under his arm. As if the angel of death had chilled all gay and
      sprightly fancies&mdash;as if that wan form had scared away the Graces to
      whom Xenocrates sacrificed&mdash;silence immediately reigned through the
      study, and every one resumed his self-possession and his pen. Aramis
      distributed the notes of invitation, and thanked them in the name of M.
      Fouquet. &ldquo;The superintendent,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;being kept to his room by
      business, could not come and see them, but begged them to send him some of
      the fruits of their day&rsquo;s work, to enable him to forget the fatigue of his
      labor in the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, all settled down to work. La Fontaine placed himself at a
      table, and set his rapid pen an endless dance across the smooth white
      vellum; Pelisson made a fair copy of his prologue; Moliere contributed
      fifty fresh verses, with which his visit to Percerin had inspired him;
      Loret, an article on the marvelous <i>fetes</i> he predicted; and Aramis,
      laden with his booty like the king of the bees, that great black drone,
      decked with purple and gold, re-entered his apartment, silent and busy.
      But before departing, &ldquo;Remember, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we leave to-morrow
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I must give notice at home,&rdquo; said Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; poor Moliere!&rdquo; said Loret, smiling; &ldquo;he loves his home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>He</i> loves,&rsquo; yes,&rdquo; replied Moliere, with his sad, sweet smile. &ldquo;&lsquo;He
      loves,&rsquo; that does not mean, they love <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said La Fontaine, &ldquo;they love me at Chateau Thierry, I am very
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis here re-entered after a brief disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will any one go with me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I am going by Paris, after having
      passed a quarter of an hour with M. Fouquet. I offer my carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Moliere, &ldquo;I accept it. I am in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall dine here,&rdquo; said Loret. &ldquo;M. de Gourville has promised me some
      craw-fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has promised me some whitings. Find a rhyme for that, La Fontaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis went out laughing, as only he could laugh, and Moliere followed
      him. They were at the bottom of the stairs, when La Fontaine opened the
      door, and shouted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has promised us some whitings, In return for these our writings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis
      opened the door of the study. As to Moliere, he had undertaken to order
      the horses, while Aramis went to exchange a parting word with the
      superintendent. &ldquo;Oh, how they are laughing there!&rdquo; said Fouquet, with a
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not laugh, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laugh no longer now, M. d&rsquo;Herblay. The <i>fete</i> is approaching;
      money is departing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not told you that was my business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you promised me millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have them the day after the king&rsquo;s <i>entree</i> into Vaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet looked closely at Aramis, and passed the back of his icy hand
      across his moistened brow. Aramis perceived that the superintendent either
      doubted him, or felt he was powerless to obtain the money. How could
      Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop, ex-abbe, ex-musketeer, could find any?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doubt me?&rdquo; said Aramis. Fouquet smiled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man of little faith!&rdquo; added the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear M. d&rsquo;Herblay,&rdquo; answered Fouquet, &ldquo;if I fall&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; if you &lsquo;fall&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall, at least, fall from such a height, that I shall shatter myself
      in falling.&rdquo; Then giving himself a shake, as though to escape from
      himself, &ldquo;Whence came you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Paris&mdash;from Percerin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you been doing at Percerin&rsquo;s, for I suppose you attach no
      great importance to our poets&rsquo; dresses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I went to prepare a surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; which you are going to give to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will it cost much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a hundred pistoles you will give Lebrun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A painting?&mdash;Ah! all the better! And what is this painting to
      represent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you; then at the same time, whatever you may say or think of
      it, I went to see the dresses for our poets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! and they will be rich and elegant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! There will be few great monseigneurs with so good. People will
      see the difference there is between the courtiers of wealth and those of
      friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever generous and grateful, dear prelate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet grasped his hand. &ldquo;And where are you going?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am off to Paris, when you shall have given a certain letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Lyonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you want with Lyonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to make him sign a <i>lettre de cachet</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Lettre de cachet!</i>&rsquo; Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary&mdash;to let somebody out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor devil&mdash;a youth, a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years,
      for two Latin verses he made against the Jesuits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Two Latin verses!&rsquo; and, for &lsquo;two Latin verses,&rsquo; the miserable being has
      been in prison for ten years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has committed no other crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond this, he is as innocent as you or I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seldon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&mdash;But it is too bad. You knew this, and you never told me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas only yesterday his mother applied to me, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the woman is poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the deepest misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;sometimes bears with such injustice on earth,
      that I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence. Stay,
      M. d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo; And Fouquet, taking a pen, wrote a few rapid lines to his
      colleague Lyonne. Aramis took the letter and made ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Fouquet. He opened his drawer, and took out ten government
      notes which were there, each for a thousand francs. &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;set
      the son at liberty, and give this to the mother; but, above all, do not
      tell her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she is ten thousand livres richer than I. She would say I am but a
      poor superintendent! Go! and I pray that God will bless those who are
      mindful of his poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So also do I pray,&rdquo; replied Aramis, kissing Fouquet&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went out quickly, carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the notes
      for Seldon&rsquo;s mother, and taking up Moliere, who was beginning to lose
      patience.

    <h2>
      Chapter VII. Another Supper at the Bastile.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Seven o&rsquo;clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile, that famous
      clock, which, like all the accessories of the state prison, the very use
      of which is a torture, recalled to the prisoners&rsquo; minds the destination of
      every hour of their punishment. The time-piece of the Bastile, adorned
      with figures, like most of the clocks of the period, represented St. Peter
      in bonds. It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives. The doors,
      grating on their enormous hinges, opened for the passage of the baskets
      and trays of provisions, the abundance and the delicacy of which, as M. de
      Baisemeaux has himself taught us, was regulated by the condition in life
      of the prisoner. We understand on this head the theories of M. de
      Baisemeaux, sovereign dispenser of gastronomic delicacies, head cook of
      the royal fortress, whose trays, full-laden, were ascending the steep
      staircases, carrying some consolation to the prisoners in the shape of
      honestly filled bottles of good vintages. This same hour was that of M. le
      gouverneur&rsquo;s supper also. He had a guest to-day, and the spit turned more
      heavily than usual. Roast partridges, flanked with quails and flanking a
      larded leveret; boiled fowls; hams, fried and sprinkled with white wine,
      <i>cardons</i> of Guipuzcoa and <i>la bisque ecrevisses</i>: these,
      together with soups and <i>hors d&rsquo;oeuvres</i>, constituted the governor&rsquo;s
      bill of fare. Baisemeaux, seated at table, was rubbing his hands and
      looking at the bishop of Vannes, who, booted like a cavalier, dressed in
      gray and sword at side, kept talking of his hunger and testifying the
      liveliest impatience. M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not accustomed to
      the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes, and this
      evening Aramis, becoming sprightly, volunteered confidence on confidence.
      The prelate had again a little touch of the musketeer about him. The
      bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of
      conversation. As for M. de Baisemeaux, with the facility of vulgar people,
      he gave himself up entirely upon this point of his guest&rsquo;s freedom.
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for indeed to-night I dare not call you
      monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;call me monsieur; I am booted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, monsieur, of whom you remind me this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! faith,&rdquo; said Aramis, taking up his glass; &ldquo;but I hope I remind you of
      a capital guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me of two, monsieur. Francois, shut the window; the wind may
      annoy his greatness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let him go,&rdquo; added Aramis. &ldquo;The supper is completely served, and we
      shall eat it very well without waiters. I like exceedingly to be <i>tete-a-tete</i>
      when I am with a friend.&rdquo; Baisemeaux bowed respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like exceedingly,&rdquo; continued Aramis, &ldquo;to help myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retire, Francois,&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux. &ldquo;I was saying that your greatness
      puts me in mind of two persons; one very illustrious, the late cardinal,
      the great Cardinal de la Rochelle, who wore boots like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;and the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other was a certain musketeer, very handsome, very brave, very
      adventurous, very fortunate, who, from being abbe, turned musketeer, and
      from musketeer turned abbe.&rdquo; Aramis condescended to smile. &ldquo;From abbe,&rdquo;
       continued Baisemeaux, encouraged by Aramis&rsquo;s smile&mdash;&ldquo;from abbe,
      bishop&mdash;and from bishop&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! stay there, I beg,&rdquo; exclaimed Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just said, monsieur, that you gave me the idea of a cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, dear M. Baisemeaux. As you said, I have on the boots of a
      cavalier, but I do not intend, for all that, to embroil myself with the
      church this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have wicked intentions, nevertheless, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, wicked, I own, as everything mundane is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You traverse the town and the streets in disguise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In disguise, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you still make use of your sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should think so; but only when I am compelled. Do me the pleasure
      to summon Francois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no wine there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not for wine, but because it is hot here, and the window is shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the
      arrival of couriers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. You hear them when the window is open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But too well, and that disturbs me. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless I am suffocated. Francois.&rdquo; Francois entered. &ldquo;Open the
      windows, I pray you, Master Francois,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;You will allow him,
      dear M. Baisemeaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are at home here,&rdquo; answered the governor. The window was opened. &ldquo;Do
      you not think,&rdquo; said M. de Baisemeaux, &ldquo;that you will find yourself very
      lonely, now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at Blois? He
      is a very old friend, is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it as I do, Baisemeaux, seeing that you were in the musketeers
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are right. But I do more than love M. de la Fere, dear
      Baisemeaux; I venerate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part, though &lsquo;tis singular,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;I prefer M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan to him. There is a man for you, who drinks long and well! That
      kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baisemeaux, make me tipsy to-night; let us have a merry time of it as of
      old, and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart, I promise you, you
      shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, and he poured out a great glass of wine and
      drank it off at a draught, trembling with joy at the idea of being, by
      hook or by crook, in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor.
      While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was noting
      the sounds in the great court. A courier came in about eight o&rsquo;clock as
      Francois brought in the fifth bottle, and, although the courier made a
      great noise, Baisemeaux heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take him,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! who?&rdquo; asked Baisemeaux. &ldquo;I hope &lsquo;tis neither the wine you drank nor
      he who is the cause of your drinking it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is a horse, who is making noise enough in the court for a whole
      squadron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! some courier or other,&rdquo; replied the governor, redoubling his
      attention to the passing bottle. &ldquo;Yes; and may the devil take him, and so
      quickly that we shall never hear him speak more. Hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget me, Baisemeaux! my glass is empty,&rdquo; said Aramis, lifting his
      dazzling Venetian goblet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor, you delight me. Francois, wine!&rdquo; Francois entered. &ldquo;Wine,
      fellow! and better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, yes; but a courier has just arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go to the devil, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him leave his news at the office; we will see to it to-morrow.
      To-morrow, there will be time to-morrow; there will be daylight,&rdquo; said
      Baisemeaux, chanting the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monsieur,&rdquo; grumbled the soldier Francois, in spite of himself,
      &ldquo;monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what? dear M. d&rsquo;Herblay,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, half intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is
      sometimes an order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not orders issue from the ministers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, undoubtedly; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the
      king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right. Nevertheless, &lsquo;tis very tiresome when you are
      sitting before a good table, <i>tete-a-tete</i> with a friend&mdash;Ah! I
      beg your pardon, monsieur; I forgot it is I who engage you at supper, and
      that I speak to a future cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us pass over that, dear Baisemeaux, and return to our soldier, to
      Francois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what has Francois done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has demurred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was wrong, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, he <i>has</i> demurred, you see; &lsquo;tis because there is something
      extraordinary in this matter. It is very possible that it was not Francois
      who was wrong in demurring, but you, who are in the wrong in not listening
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong? I to be wrong before Francois? that seems rather hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, merely an irregularity. But I thought it my duty to make an
      observation which I deem important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! perhaps you are right,&rdquo; stammered Baisemeaux. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s order is
      sacred; but as to orders that arrive when one is at supper, I repeat that
      the devil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had said as much to the great cardinal&mdash;hem! my dear
      Baisemeaux, and if his order had any importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do it that I may not disturb a bishop. <i>Mordioux!</i> am I not, then,
      excusable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget, Baisemeaux, that I have worn the soldier&rsquo;s coat, and I am
      accustomed to obedience everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that you would do your duty, my friend; yes, at least before this
      soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis mathematically true,&rdquo; exclaimed Baisemeaux. Francois still waited:
      &ldquo;Let them send this order of the king&rsquo;s up to me,&rdquo; he repeated, recovering
      himself. And he added in a low tone, &ldquo;Do you know what it is? I will tell
      you something about as interesting as this. &lsquo;Beware of fire near the
      powder magazine;&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Look close after such and such a one, who is clever
      at escaping,&rsquo; Ah! if you only knew, monseigneur, how many times I have
      been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest, deepest slumber, by
      messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me, or rather, bring me a slip
      of paper containing these words: &lsquo;Monsieur de Baisemeaux, what news?&rsquo; &lsquo;Tis
      clear enough that those who waste their time writing such orders have
      never slept in the Bastile. They would know better; they have never
      considered the thickness of my walls, the vigilance of my officers, the
      number of rounds we go. But, indeed, what can you expect, monseigneur? It
      is their business to write and torment me when I am at rest, and to
      trouble me when I am happy,&rdquo; added Baisemeaux, bowing to Aramis. &ldquo;Then let
      them do their business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you do yours,&rdquo; added the bishop, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francois re-entered; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister&rsquo;s order.
      He slowly undid it, and as slowly read it. Aramis pretended to be
      drinking, so as to be able to watch his host through the glass. Then,
      Baisemeaux, having read it: &ldquo;What was I just saying?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An order of release! There, now; excellent news indeed to disturb us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent news for him whom it concerns, you will at least agree, my dear
      governor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is charitable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! charity is all very well, but it is for that fellow who says he is so
      weary and tired, but not for me who am amusing myself,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux,
      exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you lose by him, then? And is the prisoner who is to be set at
      liberty a good payer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed! a miserable, five-franc rat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; asked M. d&rsquo;Herblay. &ldquo;It is no indiscretion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means; read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is &lsquo;Urgent,&rsquo; on the paper; you have seen that, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, admirable! &lsquo;Urgent!&rsquo;&mdash;a man who has been there ten years! It is
      <i>urgent</i> to set him free to-day, this very evening, at eight o&rsquo;clock!&mdash;<i>urgent!</i>&rdquo;
       And Baisemeaux, shrugging his shoulders with an air of supreme disdain,
      flung the order on the table and began eating again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are fond of these tricks!&rdquo; he said, with his mouth full; &ldquo;they seize
      a man, some fine day, keep him under lock and key for ten years, and write
      to you, &lsquo;Watch this fellow well,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Keep him very strictly.&rsquo; And then,
      as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a dangerous
      man, all of a sudden, without rhyme or reason they write&mdash;&lsquo;Set him at
      liberty,&rsquo; and actually add to their missive&mdash;&lsquo;urgent.&rsquo; You will own,
      my lord, &lsquo;tis enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect? It is for them to write,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;for you to
      execute the order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! good! execute it! Oh, patience! You must not imagine that I am a
      slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious Heaven! my very good M. Baisemeaux, who ever said so? Your
      independence is well known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your goodness of heart is also known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t speak of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your obedience to your superiors. Once a soldier, you see,
      Baisemeaux, always a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall directly obey; and to-morrow morning, at daybreak, the
      prisoner referred to shall be set free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not this evening, seeing that the <i>lettre de cachet</i> bears, both
      on the direction and inside, &lsquo;<i>urgent</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this evening we are at supper, and our affairs are urgent, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Baisemeaux, booted though I be, I feel myself a priest, and charity
      has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst. This unfortunate man has
      suffered long enough, since you have just told me that he has been your
      prisoner these ten years. Abridge his suffering. His good time has come;
      give him the benefit quickly. God will repay you in Paradise with years of
      felicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! in the very middle of our repast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you; such an action is worth ten Benedicites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be as you desire, only our supper will get cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! never heed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois, and by a very natural motion
      turned round towards the door. The order had remained on the table; Aramis
      seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to change the paper
      for another, folded in the same manner, which he drew swiftly from his
      pocket. &ldquo;Francois,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;let the major come up here with
      the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere.&rdquo; Francois bowed and quitted the room,
      leaving the two companions alone.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII. The General of the Order.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was now a brief silence, during which Aramis never removed his eyes
      from Baisemeaux for a moment. The latter seemed only half decided to
      disturb himself thus in the middle of supper, and it was clear he was
      trying to invent some pretext, whether good or bad, for delay, at any rate
      till after dessert. And it appeared also that he had hit upon an excuse at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! but it is impossible!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How impossible?&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Give me a glimpse of this impossibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour. Where can
      he go to, a man so unacquainted with Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will find a place wherever he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, now, one might as well set a blind man free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a carriage, and will take him wherever he wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an answer for everything. Francois, tell monsieur le major to go
      and open the cell of M. Seldon, No. 3, Bertaudiere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seldon!&rdquo; exclaimed Aramis, very naturally. &ldquo;You said Seldon, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said Seldon, of course. &lsquo;Tis the name of the man they set free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you mean to say Marchiali?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marchiali? oh! yes, indeed. No, no, Seldon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are making a mistake, Monsieur Baisemeaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read the order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I saw &lsquo;Seldon&rsquo; in letters as large as that,&rdquo; and Baisemeaux held up
      his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I read &lsquo;Marchiali&rsquo; in characters as large as this,&rdquo; said Aramis, also
      holding up two fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the proof; let us throw a light on the matter,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux,
      confident he was right. &ldquo;There is the paper, you have only to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read &lsquo;Marchiali,&rsquo;&rdquo; returned Aramis, spreading out the paper. &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux looked, and his arms dropped suddenly. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said,
      quite overwhelmed; &ldquo;yes, Marchiali. &lsquo;Tis plainly written Marchiali! Quite
      true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? the man of whom we have talked so much? The man whom they are every
      day telling me to take such care of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is &lsquo;Marchiali,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated the inflexible Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must own it, monseigneur. But I understand nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe your eyes, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell me very plainly there is &lsquo;Marchiali.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in a good handwriting, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a wonder! I still see this order and the name of Seldon, Irishman. I
      see it. Ah! I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of
      ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there is no ink; no, there is no blot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but there was, though; I know it, because I rubbed my finger&mdash;this
      very one&mdash;in the powder that was over the blot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a word, be it how it may, dear M. Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;and
      whatever you may have seen, the order is signed to release Marchiali, blot
      or no blot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The order is signed to release Marchiali,&rdquo; replied Baisemeaux,
      mechanically, endeavoring to regain his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going to release this prisoner. If your heart dictates you to
      deliver Seldon also, I declare to you I will not oppose it the least in
      the world.&rdquo; Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile, the irony of
      which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux&rsquo;s confusion of mind, and restored
      his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom the
      other day a priest confessor of <i>our order</i> came to visit in so
      imperious and so secret a manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis no such long time ago, dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. But <i>with us</i>, monsieur, it is good that the man of
      to-day should no longer know what the man of yesterday did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, &ldquo;the visit of the Jesuit confessor must
      have given happiness to this man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis made no reply, but recommenced eating and drinking. As for
      Baisemeaux, no longer touching anything that was on the table, he again
      took up the order and examined it every way. This investigation, under
      ordinary circumstances, would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis
      burn with anger; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for so
      little, above all, when he had murmured to himself that to do so was
      dangerous. &ldquo;Are you going to release Marchiali?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What mellow,
      fragrant and delicious sherry this is, my dear governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Baisemeaux, &ldquo;I shall release the prisoner Marchiali
      when I have summoned the courier who brought the order, and above all,
      when, by interrogating him, I have satisfied myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The order is sealed, and the courier is ignorant of the contents. What do
      you want to satisfy yourself about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, monseigneur; but I shall send to the ministry, and M. de Lyonne
      will either confirm or withdraw the order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of all that?&rdquo; asked Aramis, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what is your object, I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The object of never deceiving oneself, monseigneur; nor being wanting in
      the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers, nor
      infringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one&rsquo;s own free
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; you have just spoken so eloquently, that I cannot but admire
      you. It is true that a subaltern owes respect to his superiors; he is
      guilty when he deceives himself, and he should be punished if he infringed
      either the duties or laws of his office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux looked at the bishop with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It follows,&rdquo; pursued Aramis, &ldquo;that you are going to ask advice, to put
      your conscience at ease in the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if a superior officer gives you orders, you will obey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never doubt it, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the king&rsquo;s signature well, M. de Baisemeaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not on this order of release?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, but it may&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be forged, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is evident, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. And that of M. de Lyonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it plain enough on the order; but for the same reason that the
      king&rsquo;s signature may have been forged, so also, and with even greater
      probability, may M. de Lyonne&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your logic has the stride of a giant, M. de Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said Aramis;
      &ldquo;and your reasoning is irresistible. But on what special grounds do you
      base your idea that these signatures are false?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On this: the absence of counter-signatures. Nothing checks his majesty&rsquo;s
      signature; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur de Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said Aramis, bending an eagle glance on
      the governor, &ldquo;I adopt so frankly your doubts, and your mode of clearing
      them up, that I will take a pen, if you will give me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux gave him a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a sheet of white paper,&rdquo; added Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux handed him some paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I&mdash;I, also&mdash;I, here present&mdash;incontestably, I&mdash;am
      going to write an order to which I am certain you will give credence,
      incredulous as you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner. It seemed to him
      that the voice of the bishop&rsquo;s, but just now so playful and gay, had
      become funereal and sad; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of a
      mortuary chapel, the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis took a pen and wrote. Baisemeaux, in terror, read over his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. M. D. G.,&rdquo; wrote the bishop; and he drew a cross under these four
      letters, which signify <i>ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>, &ldquo;to the greater
      glory of God;&rdquo; and thus he continued: &ldquo;It is our pleasure that the order
      brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun, governor, for the king, of the
      castle of the Bastile, be held by him good and effectual, and be
      immediately carried into operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Signed) D&rsquo;HERBLAY
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General of the Order, by the grace of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux was so profoundly astonished, that his features remained
      contracted, his lips parted, and his eyes fixed. He did not move an inch,
      nor articulate a sound. Nothing could be heard in that large chamber but
      the wing-whisper of a little moth, which was fluttering to its death about
      the candles. Aramis, without even deigning to look at the man whom he had
      reduced to so miserable a condition, drew from his pocket a small case of
      black wax; he sealed the letter, and stamped it with a seal suspended at
      his breast, beneath his doublet, and when the operation was concluded,
      presented&mdash;still in silence&mdash;the missive to M. de Baisemeaux.
      The latter, whose hands trembled in a manner to excite pity, turned a dull
      and meaningless gaze upon the letter. A last gleam of feeling played over
      his features, and he fell, as if thunder-struck, on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Aramis, after a long silence, during which the governor
      of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses, &ldquo;do not lead me to
      believe, dear Baisemeaux, that the presence of the general of the order is
      as terrible as His, and that men die merely from having seen Him. Take
      courage, rouse yourself; give me your hand&mdash;obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux, reassured, if not satisfied, obeyed, kissed Aramis&rsquo;s hand, and
      rose. &ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is no pressing haste, my host; take your place again, and do
      the honors over this beautiful dessert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, I shall never recover such a shock as this; I who have
      laughed, who have jested with you! I who have dared to treat you on a
      footing of equality!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say nothing about it, old comrade,&rdquo; replied the bishop, who perceived how
      strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break it;
      &ldquo;say nothing about it. Let us each live in our own way; to you, my
      protection and my friendship; to me, your obedience. Having exactly
      fulfilled these two requirements, let us live happily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux reflected; he perceived, at a glance, the consequence of this
      withdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order; and, putting in the
      scale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general, did
      not consider it of any value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis divined this. &ldquo;My dear Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are a simpleton.
      Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble to think for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at another gesture he made, Baisemeaux bowed again. &ldquo;How shall I set
      about it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the process for releasing a prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the regulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, follow the regulations, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go with my major to the prisoner&rsquo;s room, and conduct him, if he is a
      personage of importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this Marchiali is not an important personage,&rdquo; said Aramis
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the governor, as if he would have said, &ldquo;It is
      for you to instruct me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you don&rsquo;t know it, I am right; so act towards Marchiali as you
      act towards one of obscure station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; the regulations so provide. They are to the effect that the
      turnkey, or one of the lower officials, shall bring the prisoner before
      the governor, in the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;tis very wise, that; and then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his
      imprisonment, his clothes and papers, if the minister&rsquo;s orders have not
      otherwise dictated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the minister&rsquo;s order as to this Marchiali?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels, without papers,
      and almost without clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how simple, then, all is. Indeed, Baisemeaux, you make a mountain of
      everything. Remain here, and make them bring the prisoner to the
      governor&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux obeyed. He summoned his lieutenant, and gave him an order,
      which the latter passed on, without disturbing himself about it, to the
      next whom it concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards they heard a gate shut in the court; it was the
      door to the dungeon, which had just rendered up its prey to the free air.
      Aramis blew out all the candles which lighted the room but one, which he
      left burning behind the door. This flickering glare prevented the sight
      from resting steadily on any object. It multiplied tenfold the changing
      forms and shadows of the place, by its wavering uncertainty. Steps drew
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and meet your men,&rdquo; said Aramis to Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor obeyed. The sergeant and turnkeys disappeared. Baisemeaux
      re-entered, followed by a prisoner. Aramis had placed himself in the
      shade; he saw without being seen. Baisemeaux, in an agitated tone of
      voice, made the young man acquainted with the order which set him at
      liberty. The prisoner listened, without making a single gesture or saying
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will swear (&lsquo;tis the regulation that requires it),&rdquo; added the
      governor, &ldquo;never to reveal anything that you have seen or heard in the
      Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner perceived a crucifix; he stretched out his hands and swore
      with his lips. &ldquo;And now, monsieur, you are free. Whither do you intend
      going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner turned his head, as if looking behind him for some
      protection, on which he ought to rely. Then was it that Aramis came out of
      the shade: &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to render the gentleman whatever service
      he may please to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner slightly reddened, and, without hesitation, passed his arm
      through that of Aramis. &ldquo;God have you in his holy keeping,&rdquo; he said, in a
      voice the firmness of which made the governor tremble as much as the form
      of the blessing astonished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, on shaking hands with Baisemeaux, said to him; &ldquo;Does my order
      trouble you? Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to
      search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire to keep it, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux. &ldquo;If they found it
      here, it would be a certain indication I should be lost, and in that case
      you would be a powerful and a last auxiliary for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being your accomplice, you mean?&rdquo; answered Aramis, shrugging his
      shoulders. &ldquo;Adieu, Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were in waiting, making each rusty spring reverberate the
      carriage again with their impatience. Baisemeaux accompanied the bishop to
      the bottom of the steps. Aramis caused his companion to mount before him,
      then followed, and without giving the driver any further order, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo;
       said he. The carriage rattled over the pavement of the courtyard. An
      officer with a torch went before the horses, and gave orders at every post
      to let them pass. During the time taken in opening all the barriers,
      Aramis barely breathed, and you might have heard his &ldquo;sealed heart knock
      against his ribs.&rdquo; The prisoner, buried in a corner of the carriage, made
      no more sign of life than his companion. At length, a jolt more sever than
      the others announced to them that they had cleared the last watercourse.
      Behind the carriage closed the last gate, that in the Rue St. Antoine. No
      more walls either on the right or the left; heaven everywhere, liberty
      everywhere, and life everywhere. The horses, kept in check by a vigorous
      hand, went quietly as far as the middle of the faubourg. There they began
      to trot. Little by little, whether they were warming to their work, or
      whether they were urged, they gained in swiftness, and once past Bercy,
      the carriage seemed to fly, so great was the ardor of the coursers. The
      horses galloped thus as far as Villeneuve St. George&rsquo;s, where relays were
      waiting. Then four instead of two whirled the carriage away in the
      direction of Melun, and pulled up for a moment in the middle of the forest
      of Senart. No doubt the order had been given the postilion beforehand, for
      Aramis had no occasion even to make a sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the prisoner, as if waking from a long dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that before going further, it
      is necessary your royal highness and I should converse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will await an opportunity, monsieur,&rdquo; answered the young prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not have a better, monseigneur. We are in the middle of a
      forest, and no one can hear us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The postilion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The postilion of this relay is deaf and dumb, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service, M. d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your pleasure to remain in the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we are comfortably seated, and I like this carriage, for it has
      restored me to liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, monseigneur; there is yet a precaution to be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are here on the highway; cavaliers or carriages traveling like
      ourselves might pass, and seeing us stopping, deem us in some difficulty.
      Let us avoid offers of assistance, which would embarrass us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the postilion orders to conceal the carriage in one of the side
      avenues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis exactly what I wished to do, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis made a sign to the deaf and dumb driver of the carriage, whom he
      touched on the arm. The latter dismounted, took the leaders by the bridle,
      and led them over the velvet sward and the mossy grass of a winding alley,
      at the bottom of which, on this moonless night, the deep shades formed a
      curtain blacker than ink. This done, the man lay down on a slope near his
      horses, who, on either side, kept nibbling the young oak shoots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; said the young prince to Aramis; &ldquo;but what are you doing
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am disarming myself of my pistols, of which we have no further need,
      monseigneur.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter IX. The Tempter.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My prince,&rdquo; said Aramis, turning in the carriage towards his companion,
      &ldquo;weak creature as I am, so unpretending in genius, so low in the scale of
      intelligent beings, it has never yet happened to me to converse with a man
      without penetrating his thoughts through that living mask which has been
      thrown over our mind, in order to retain its expression. But to-night, in
      this darkness, in the reserve which you maintain, I can read nothing on
      your features, and something tells me that I shall have great difficulty
      in wresting from you a sincere declaration. I beseech you, then, not for
      love of me, for subjects should never weigh as anything in the balance
      which princes hold, but for love of yourself, to retain every syllable,
      every inflexion which, under the present most grave circumstances, will
      all have a sense and value as important as any every uttered in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I listen,&rdquo; replied the young prince, &ldquo;decidedly, without either eagerly
      seeking or fearing anything you are about to say to me.&rdquo; And he buried
      himself still deeper in the thick cushions of the carriage, trying to
      deprive his companion not only of the sight of him, but even of the very
      idea of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black was the darkness which fell wide and dense from the summits of the
      intertwining trees. The carriage, covered in by this prodigious roof,
      would not have received a particle of light, not even if a ray could have
      struggled through the wreaths of mist that were already rising in the
      avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; resumed Aramis, &ldquo;you know the history of the government
      which to-day controls France. The king issued from an infancy imprisoned
      like yours, obscure as yours, and confined as yours; only, instead of
      ending, like yourself, this slavery in a prison, this obscurity in
      solitude, these straightened circumstances in concealment, he was fain to
      bear all these miseries, humiliations, and distresses, in full daylight,
      under the pitiless sun of royalty; on an elevation flooded with light,
      where every stain appears a blemish, every glory a stain. The king has
      suffered; it rankles in his mind; and he will avenge himself. He will be a
      bad king. I say not that he will pour out his people&rsquo;s blood, like Louis
      XI., or Charles IX.; for he has no mortal injuries to avenge; but he will
      devour the means and substance of his people; for he has himself undergone
      wrongs in his own interest and money. In the first place, then, I acquit
      my conscience, when I consider openly the merits and the faults of this
      great prince; and if I condemn him, my conscience absolves me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis paused. It was not to listen if the silence of the forest remained
      undisturbed, but it was to gather up his thoughts from the very bottom of
      his soul&mdash;to leave the thoughts he had uttered sufficient time to eat
      deeply into the mind of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that Heaven does, Heaven does well,&rdquo; continued the bishop of Vannes;
      &ldquo;and I am so persuaded of it that I have long been thankful to have been
      chosen depositary of the secret which I have aided you to discover. To a
      just Providence was necessary an instrument, at once penetrating,
      persevering, and convinced, to accomplish a great work. I am this
      instrument. I possess penetration, perseverance, conviction; I govern a
      mysterious people, who has taken for its motto, the motto of God, &lsquo;<i>Patiens
      quia oeternus</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; The prince moved. &ldquo;I divine, monseigneur, why you are
      raising your head, and are surprised at the people I have under my
      command. You did not know you were dealing with a king&mdash;oh!
      monseigneur, king of a people very humble, much disinherited; humble
      because they have no force save when creeping; disinherited, because
      never, almost never in this world, do my people reap the harvest they sow,
      nor eat the fruit they cultivate. They labor for an abstract idea; they
      heap together all the atoms of their power, so from a single man; and
      round this man, with the sweat of their labor, they create a misty halo,
      which his genius shall, in turn, render a glory gilded with the rays of
      all the crowns in Christendom. Such is the man you have beside you,
      monseigneur. It is to tell you that he has drawn you from the abyss for a
      great purpose, to raise you above the powers of the earth&mdash;above
      himself.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince lightly touched Aramis&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;You speak to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of
      that religious order whose chief you are. For me, the result of your words
      is, that the day you desire to hurl down the man you shall have raised,
      the event will be accomplished; and that you will keep under your hand
      your creation of yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undeceive yourself, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the bishop. &ldquo;I should not take
      the trouble to play this terrible game with your royal highness, if I had
      not a double interest in gaining it. The day you are elevated, you are
      elevated forever; you will overturn the footstool, as you rise, and will
      send it rolling so far, that not even the sight of it will ever again
      recall to you its right to simple gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your movement, monseigneur, arises from an excellent disposition. I thank
      you. Be well assured, I aspire to more than gratitude! I am convinced
      that, when arrived at the summit, you will judge me still more worthy to
      be your friend; and then, monseigneur, we two will do such great deeds,
      that ages hereafter shall long speak of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me plainly, monsieur&mdash;tell me without disguise&mdash;what I am
      to-day, and what you aim at my being to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the son of King Louis XIII., brother of Louis XIV., natural and
      legitimate heir to the throne of France. In keeping you near him, as
      Monsieur has been kept&mdash;Monsieur, your younger brother&mdash;the king
      reserved to himself the right of being legitimate sovereign. The doctors
      only could dispute his legitimacy. But the doctors always prefer the king
      who is to the king who is not. Providence has willed that you should be
      persecuted; this persecution to-day consecrates you king of France. You
      had, then, a right to reign, seeing that it is disputed; you had a right
      to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed; and you possess
      royal blood, since no one has dared to shed yours, as that of your
      servants has been shed. Now see, then, what this Providence, which you
      have so often accused of having in every way thwarted you, has done for
      you. It has given you the features, figure, age, and voice of your
      brother; and the very causes of your persecution are about to become those
      of your triumphant restoration. To-morrow, after to-morrow&mdash;from the
      very first, regal phantom, living shade of Louis XIV., you will sit upon
      his throne, whence the will of Heaven, confided in execution to the arm of
      man, will have hurled him, without hope of return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;my brother&rsquo;s blood will not be shed,
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be sole arbiter of his fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The secret of which they made an evil use against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will employ it against him. What did he do to conceal it? He
      concealed you. Living image of himself, you will defeat the conspiracy of
      Mazarin and Anne of Austria. You, my prince, will have the same interest
      in concealing him, who will, as a prisoner, resemble you, as you will
      resemble him as a king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fall back on what I was saying to you. Who will guard him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who guarded <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know this secret&mdash;you have made use of it with regard to myself.
      Who else knows it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen-mother and Madame de Chevreuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, if you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can
      recognize you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis true; but there are grave difficulties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;State them, prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is married; I cannot take my brother&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will cause Spain to consent to a divorce; it is in the interest of your
      new policy; it is human morality. All that is really noble and really
      useful in this world will find its account therein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The imprisoned king will speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom do you think he will speak&mdash;to the walls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, by walls, the men in whom you put confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If need be, yes. And besides, your royal highness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say, that the designs of Providence do not stop on such a
      fair road. Every scheme of this caliber is completed by its results, like
      a geometrical calculation. The king, in prison, will not be for you the
      cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned. His soul
      is naturally proud and impatient; it is, moreover, disarmed and enfeebled,
      by being accustomed to honors, and by the license of supreme power. The
      same Providence which has willed that the concluding step in the
      geometrical calculation I have had the honor of describing to your royal
      highness should be your ascension to the throne, and the destruction of
      him who is hurtful to you, has also determined that the conquered one
      shall soon end both his own and your sufferings. Therefore, his soul and
      body have been adapted for but a brief agony. Put into prison as a private
      individual, left alone with your doubts, deprived of everything, you have
      exhibited the most sublime, enduring principle of life in withstanding all
      this. But your brother, a captive, forgotten, and in bonds, will not long
      endure the calamity; and Heaven will resume his soul at the appointed time&mdash;that
      is to say, soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point in Aramis&rsquo;s gloomy analysis, a bird of night uttered from
      the depths of the forest that prolonged and plaintive cry which makes
      every creature tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will exile the deposed king,&rdquo; said Philippe, shuddering; &ldquo;&lsquo;twill be
      more human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s good pleasure will decide the point,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;But has
      the problem been well put? Have I brought out of the solution according to
      the wishes or the foresight of your royal highness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, yes; you have forgotten nothing&mdash;except, indeed, two
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us speak of it at once, with the same frankness we have already
      conversed in. Let us speak of the causes which may bring about the ruin of
      all the hopes we have conceived. Let us speak of the risks we are
      running.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would be immense, infinite, terrific, insurmountable, if, as I have
      said, all things did not concur to render them of absolutely no account.
      There is no danger either for you or for me, if the constancy and
      intrepidity of your royal highness are equal to that perfection of
      resemblance to your brother which nature has bestowed upon you. I repeat
      it, there are no dangers, only obstacles; a word, indeed, which I find in
      all languages, but have always ill-understood, and, were I king, would
      have obliterated as useless and absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, monsieur; there is a very serious obstacle, an
      insurmountable danger, which you are forgetting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is conscience, which cries aloud; remorse, that never dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said the bishop; &ldquo;there is a weakness of heart of which you
      remind me. You are right, too, for that, indeed, is an immense obstacle.
      The horse afraid of the ditch, leaps into the middle of it, and is killed!
      The man who trembling crosses his sword with that of another leaves
      loopholes whereby his enemy has him in his power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a brother?&rdquo; said the young man to Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am alone in the world,&rdquo; said the latter, with a hard, dry voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?&rdquo; added
      Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one!&mdash;Yes, I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man sank into so profound a silence, that the mere sound of his
      respiration seemed like a roaring tumult for Aramis. &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he
      resumed, &ldquo;I have not said all I had to say to your royal highness; I have
      not offered you all the salutary counsels and useful resources which I
      have at my disposal. It is useless to flash bright visions before the eyes
      of one who seeks and loves darkness: useless, too, is it to let the
      magnificence of the cannon&rsquo;s roar make itself heard in the ears of one who
      loves repose and the quiet of the country. Monseigneur, I have your
      happiness spread out before me in my thoughts; listen to my words;
      precious they indeed are, in their import and their sense, for you who
      look with such tender regard upon the bright heavens, the verdant meadows,
      the pure air. I know a country instinct with delights of every kind, an
      unknown paradise, a secluded corner of the world&mdash;where alone,
      unfettered and unknown, in the thick covert of the woods, amidst flowers,
      and streams of rippling water, you will forget all the misery that human
      folly has so recently allotted you. Oh! listen to me, my prince. I do not
      jest. I have a heart, and mind, and soul, and can read your own,&mdash;aye,
      even to its depths. I will not take you unready for your task, in order to
      cast you into the crucible of my own desires, of my caprice, or my
      ambition. Let it be all or nothing. You are chilled and galled, sick at
      heart, overcome by excess of the emotions which but one hour&rsquo;s liberty has
      produced in you. For me, that is a certain and unmistakable sign that you
      do not wish to continue at liberty. Would you prefer a more humble life, a
      life more suited to your strength? Heaven is my witness, that I wish your
      happiness to be the result of the trial to which I have exposed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, speak,&rdquo; said the prince, with a vivacity which did not escape
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; resumed the prelate, &ldquo;in the Bas-Poitou, a canton, of which no
      one in France suspects the existence. Twenty leagues of country is
      immense, is it not? Twenty leagues, monseigneur, all covered with water
      and herbage, and reeds of the most luxuriant nature; the whole studded
      with islands covered with woods of the densest foliage. These large
      marshes, covered with reeds as with a thick mantle, sleep silently and
      calmly beneath the sun&rsquo;s soft and genial rays. A few fishermen with their
      families indolently pass their lives away there, with their great
      living-rafts of poplar and alder, the flooring formed of reeds, and the
      roof woven out of thick rushes. These barks, these floating-houses, are
      wafted to and fro by the changing winds. Whenever they touch a bank, it is
      but by chance; and so gently, too, that the sleeping fisherman is not
      awakened by the shock. Should he wish to land, it is merely because he has
      seen a large flight of landrails or plovers, of wild ducks, teal, widgeon,
      or woodchucks, which fall an easy pray to net or gun. Silver shad, eels,
      greedy pike, red and gray mullet, swim in shoals into his nets; he has but
      to choose the finest and largest, and return the others to the waters.
      Never yet has the food of the stranger, be he soldier or simple citizen,
      never has any one, indeed, penetrated into that district. The sun&rsquo;s rays
      there are soft and tempered: in plots of solid earth, whose soil is swart
      and fertile, grows the vine, nourishing with generous juice its purple,
      white, and golden grapes. Once a week, a boat is sent to deliver the bread
      which has been baked at an oven&mdash;the common property of all. There&mdash;like
      the seigneurs of early days&mdash;powerful in virtue of your dogs, your
      fishing-lines, your guns, and your beautiful reed-built house, would you
      live, rich in the produce of the chase, in plentitude of absolute secrecy.
      There would years of your life roll away, at the end of which, no longer
      recognizable, for you would have been perfectly transformed, you would
      have succeeded in acquiring a destiny accorded to you by Heaven. There are
      a thousand pistoles in this bag, monseigneur&mdash;more, far more, than
      sufficient to purchase the whole marsh of which I have spoken; more than
      enough to live there as many years as you have days to live; more than
      enough to constitute you the richest, the freest, and the happiest man in
      the country. Accept it, as I offer it you&mdash;sincerely, cheerfully.
      Forthwith, without a moment&rsquo;s pause, I will unharness two of my horses,
      which are attached to the carriage yonder, and they, accompanied by my
      servant&mdash;my deaf and dumb attendant&mdash;shall conduct you&mdash;traveling
      throughout the night, sleeping during the day&mdash;to the locality I have
      described; and I shall, at least, have the satisfaction of knowing that I
      have rendered to my prince the major service he himself preferred. I shall
      have made one human being happy; and Heaven for that will hold me in
      better account than if I had made one man powerful; the former task is far
      more difficult. And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?
      Here is the money. Nay, do not hesitate. At Poitou, you can risk nothing,
      except the chance of catching the fevers prevalent there; and even of
      them, the so-called wizards of the country will cure you, for the sake of
      your pistoles. If you play the other game, you run the chance of being
      assassinated on a throne, strangled in a prison-cell. Upon my soul, I
      assure you, now I begin to compare them together, I myself should hesitate
      which lot I should accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the young prince, &ldquo;before I determine, let me alight
      from this carriage, walk on the ground, and consult that still voice
      within me, which Heaven bids us all to hearken to. Ten minutes is all I
      ask, and then you shall have your answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Aramis, bending before him with
      respect, so solemn and august in tone and address had sounded these
      strange words.

    <h2>
      Chapter X. Crown and Tiara.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aramis was the first to descend from the carriage; he held the door open
      for the young man. He saw him place his foot on the mossy ground with a
      trembling of the whole body, and walk round the carriage with an unsteady
      and almost tottering step. It seemed as if the poor prisoner was
      unaccustomed to walk on God&rsquo;s earth. It was the 15th of August, about
      eleven o&rsquo;clock at night; thick clouds, portending a tempest, overspread
      the heavens, and shrouded every light and prospect underneath their heavy
      folds. The extremities of the avenues were imperceptibly detached from the
      copse, by a lighter shadow of opaque gray, which, upon closer examination,
      became visible in the midst of the obscurity. But the fragrance which
      ascended from the grass, fresher and more penetrating than that which
      exhaled from the trees around him; the warm and balmy air which enveloped
      him for the first time for many years past; the ineffable enjoyment of
      liberty in an open country, spoke to the prince in so seductive a
      language, that notwithstanding the preternatural caution, we would almost
      say dissimulation of his character, of which we have tried to give an
      idea, he could not restrain his emotion, and breathed a sigh of ecstasy.
      Then, by degrees, he raised his aching head and inhaled the softly scented
      air, as it was wafted in gentle gusts to his uplifted face. Crossing his
      arms on his chest, as if to control this new sensation of delight, he
      drank in delicious draughts of that mysterious air which interpenetrates
      at night the loftiest forests. The sky he was contemplating, the murmuring
      waters, the universal freshness&mdash;was not all this reality? Was not
      Aramis a madman to suppose that he had aught else to dream of in this
      world? Those exciting pictures of country life, so free from fears and
      troubles, the ocean of happy days that glitters incessantly before all
      young imaginations, are real allurements wherewith to fascinate a poor,
      unhappy prisoner, worn out by prison cares, emaciated by the stifling air
      of the Bastile. It was the picture, it will be remembered, drawn by
      Aramis, when he offered the thousand pistoles he had with him in the
      carriage to the prince, and the enchanted Eden which the deserts of
      Bas-Poitou hid from the eyes of the world. Such were the reflections of
      Aramis as he watched, with an anxiety impossible to describe, the silent
      progress of the emotions of Philippe, whom he perceived gradually becoming
      more and more absorbed in his meditations. The young prince was offering
      up an inward prayer to Heaven, to be divinely guided in this trying
      moment, upon which his life or death depended. It was an anxious time for
      the bishop of Vannes, who had never before been so perplexed. His iron
      will, accustomed to overcome all obstacles, never finding itself inferior
      or vanquished on any occasion, to be foiled in so vast a project from not
      having foreseen the influence which a view of nature in all its luxuriance
      would have on the human mind! Aramis, overwhelmed by anxiety, contemplated
      with emotion the painful struggle that was taking place in Philippe&rsquo;s
      mind. This suspense lasted the whole ten minutes which the young man had
      requested. During this space of time, which appeared an eternity, Philippe
      continued gazing with an imploring and sorrowful look towards the heavens;
      Aramis did not remove the piercing glance he had fixed on Philippe.
      Suddenly the young man bowed his head. His thought returned to the earth,
      his looks perceptibly hardened, his brow contracted, his mouth assuming an
      expression of undaunted courage; again his looks became fixed, but this
      time they wore a worldly expression, hardened by covetousness, pride, and
      strong desire. Aramis&rsquo;s look immediately became as soft as it had before
      been gloomy. Philippe, seizing his hand in a quick, agitated manner,
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead me to where the crown of France is to be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your decision, monseigneur?&rdquo; asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irrevocably so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philippe did not even deign to reply. He gazed earnestly at the bishop, as
      if to ask him if it were possible for a man to waver after having once
      made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such looks are flashes of the hidden fire that betrays men&rsquo;s character,&rdquo;
       said Aramis, bowing over Philippe&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;you will be great, monseigneur,
      I will answer for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us resume our conversation. I wished to discuss two points with you;
      in the first place the dangers, or the obstacles we may meet with. That
      point is decided. The other is the conditions you intend imposing on me.
      It is your turn to speak, M. d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conditions, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. You will not allow so mere a trifle to stop me, and you will
      not do me the injustice to suppose that I think you have no interest in
      this affair. Therefore, without subterfuge or hesitation, tell me the
      truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so, monseigneur. Once a king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow evening&mdash;I mean in the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I shall have asked your highness a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent to your highness a man in my confidence with instructions to
      deliver some closely written notes, carefully drawn up, which will
      thoroughly acquaint your highness with the different persons who compose
      and will compose your court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perused those notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attentively?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know them by heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And understand them? Pardon me, but I may venture to ask that question of
      a poor, abandoned captive of the Bastile? In a week&rsquo;s time it will not be
      requisite to further question a mind like yours. You will then be in full
      possession of liberty and power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interrogate me, then, and I will be a scholar representing his lesson to
      his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will begin with your family, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother, Anne of Austria! all her sorrows, her painful malady. Oh! I
      know her&mdash;I know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your second brother?&rdquo; asked Aramis, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To these notes,&rdquo; replied the prince, &ldquo;you have added portraits so
      faithfully painted, that I am able to recognize the persons whose
      characters, manners, and history you have so carefully portrayed.
      Monsieur, my brother, is a fine, dark young man, with a pale face; he does
      not love his wife, Henrietta, whom I, Louis XIV., loved a little, and
      still flirt with, even although she made me weep on the day she wished to
      dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere from her service in disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to be careful with regard to the watchfulness of the
      latter,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;she is sincerely attached to the actual king. The
      eyes of a woman who loves are not easily deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is fair, has blue eyes, whose affectionate gaze reveals her identity.
      She halts slightly in her gait; she writes a letter every day, to which I
      have to send an answer by M. de Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the latter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I saw him, and I know the last verses he composed for me, as well
      as those I composed in answer to his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Do you know your ministers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colbert, an ugly, dark-browed man, but intelligent enough, his hair
      covering his forehead, a large, heavy, full head; the mortal enemy of M.
      Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the latter, we need not disturb ourselves about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; because necessarily you will not require me to exile him, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, struck with admiration at the remark, said, &ldquo;You will become very
      great, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; added the prince, &ldquo;that I know my lesson by heart, and with
      Heaven&rsquo;s assistance, and yours afterwards, I shall seldom go wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have still an awkward pair of eyes to deal with, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the captain of the musketeers, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I can well say &lsquo;my friend.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who escorted La Valliere to Le Chaillot; he who delivered up Monk,
      cooped in an iron box, to Charles II.; he who so faithfully served my
      mother; he to whom the crown of France owes so much that it owes
      everything. Do you intend to ask me to exile him also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, sire. D&rsquo;Artagnan is a man to whom, at a certain given time, I will
      undertake to reveal everything; but be on your guard with him, for if he
      discovers our plot before it is revealed to him, you or I will certainly
      be killed or taken. He is a bold and enterprising man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think it over. Now tell me about M. Fouquet; what do you wish to
      be done with regard to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment more, I entreat you, monseigneur; and forgive me, if I seem to
      fail in respect to questioning you further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your duty to do so, nay, more than that, your right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we pass to M. Fouquet, I should very much regret forgetting
      another friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. du Vallon, the Hercules of France, you mean; oh! as far as he is
      concerned, his interests are more than safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is not he whom I intended to refer to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Comte de la Fere, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his son, the son of all four of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor boy who is dying of love for La Valliere, whom my brother so
      disloyally bereft him of? Be easy on that score. I shall know how to
      rehabilitate his happiness. Tell me only one thing, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay; do
      men, when they love, forget the treachery that has been shown them? Can a
      man ever forgive the woman who has betrayed him? Is that a French custom,
      or is it one of the laws of the human heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who loves deeply, as deeply as Raoul loves Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere, finishes by forgetting the fault or crime of the woman he loves;
      but I do not yet know whether Raoul will be able to forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see after that. Have you anything further to say about your
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, now for M. Fouquet. What do you wish me to do for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep him on as surintendant, in the capacity in which he has hitherto
      acted, I entreat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so; but he is the first minister at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A king, ignorant and embarrassed as I shall be, will, as a matter of
      course, require a first minister of state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty will require a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one, and that is yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have many others by and by, but none so devoted, none so zealous
      for your glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be my first minister of state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not immediately, monseigneur, for that would give rise to too much
      suspicion and astonishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Richelieu, the first minister of my grandmother, Marie de Medici,
      was simply bishop of Lucon, as you are bishop of Vannes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive that your royal highness has studied my notes to great
      advantage; your amazing perspicacity overpowers me with delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly aware that M. de Richelieu, by means of the queen&rsquo;s
      protection, soon became cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better,&rdquo; said Aramis, bowing, &ldquo;that I should not be appointed
      first minister until your royal highness has procured my nomination as
      cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be nominated before two months are past, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay.
      But that is a matter of very trifling moment; you would not offend me if
      you were to ask more than that, and you would cause me serious regret if
      you were to limit yourself to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I have something still further to hope for, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak! speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet will not keep long at the head of affairs, he will soon get
      old. He is fond of pleasure, consistently, I mean, with all his labors,
      thanks to the youthfulness he still retains; but this protracted youth
      will disappear at the approach of the first serious annoyance, or at the
      first illness he may experience. We will spare him the annoyance, because
      he is an agreeable and noble-hearted man; but we cannot save him from
      ill-health. So it is determined. When you shall have paid all M. Fouquet&rsquo;s
      debts, and restored the finances to a sound condition, M. Fouquet will be
      able to remain the sovereign ruler in his little court of poets and
      painters,&mdash;we shall have made him rich. When that has been done, and
      I have become your royal highness&rsquo;s prime minister, I shall be able to
      think of my own interests and yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked at his interrogator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Richelieu, of whom we were speaking just now, was very much to
      blame in the fixed idea he had of governing France alone, unaided. He
      allowed two kings, King Louis XIII. and himself, to be seated on the
      self-same throne, whilst he might have installed them more conveniently
      upon two separate and distinct thrones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon two thrones?&rdquo; said the young man, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; pursued Aramis, quietly, &ldquo;a cardinal, prime minister of France,
      assisted by the favor and by the countenance of his Most Christian Majesty
      the King of France, a cardinal to whom the king his master lends the
      treasures of the state, his army, his counsel, such a man would be acting
      with twofold injustice in applying these mighty resources to France alone.
      Besides,&rdquo; added Aramis, &ldquo;you will not be a king such as your father was,
      delicate in health, slow in judgment, whom all things wearied; you will be
      a king governing by your brain and by your sword; you will have in the
      government of the state no more than you will be able to manage unaided; I
      should only interfere with you. Besides, our friendship ought never to be,
      I do not say impaired, but in any degree affected, by a secret thought. I
      shall have given you the throne of France, you will confer on me the
      throne of St. Peter. Whenever your loyal, firm, and mailed hand should
      joined in ties of intimate association the hand of a pope such as I shall
      be, neither Charles V., who owned two-thirds of the habitable globe, nor
      Charlemagne, who possessed it entirely, will be able to reach to half your
      stature. I have no alliances, I have no predilections; I will not throw
      you into persecutions of heretics, nor will I cast you into the troubled
      waters of family dissension; I will simply say to you: The whole universe
      is our own; for me the minds of men, for you their bodies. And as I shall
      be the first to die, you will have my inheritance. What do you say of my
      plan, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that you render me happy and proud, for no other reason than that
      of having comprehended you thoroughly. Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay, you shall be
      cardinal, and when cardinal, my prime minister; and then you will point
      out to me the necessary steps to be taken to secure your election as pope,
      and I will take them. You can ask what guarantees from me you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless. Never shall I act except in such a manner that you will be
      the gainer; I shall never ascend the ladder of fortune, fame, or position,
      until I have first seen you placed upon the round of the ladder
      immediately above me; I shall always hold myself sufficiently aloof from
      you to escape incurring your jealousy, sufficiently near to sustain your
      personal advantage and to watch over your friendship. All the contracts in
      the world are easily violated because the interests included in them
      incline more to one side than to another. With us, however, this will
      never be the case; I have no need of any guarantees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;my dear brother&mdash;will disappear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply. We will remove him from his bed by means of a plank which yields
      to the pressure of the finger. Having retired to rest a crowned sovereign,
      he will awake a captive. Alone you will rule from that moment, and you
      will have no interest dearer and better than that of keeping me near you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it. There is my hand on it, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to kneel before you, sire, most respectfully. We will embrace
      each other on the day we shall have upon our temples, you the crown, I the
      tiara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still embrace me this very day also, and be, for and towards me, more
      than great, more than skillful, more than sublime in genius; be kind and
      indulgent&mdash;be my father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis was almost overcome as he listened to his voice; he fancied he
      detected in his own heart an emotion hitherto unknown; but this impression
      was speedily removed. &ldquo;His father!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;yes, his Holy Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they resumed their places in the carriage, which sped rapidly along
      the road leading to Vaux-le-Vicomte.

    <h2>
      Chapter XI. The Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte, situated about a league from Melun, had
      been built by Fouquet in 1655, at a time when there was a scarcity of
      money in France; Mazarin had taken all that there was, and Fouquet
      expended the remainder. However, as certain men have fertile, false, and
      useful vices, Fouquet, in scattering broadcast millions of money in the
      construction of this palace, had found a means of gathering, as the result
      of his generous profusion, three illustrious men together: Levau, the
      architect of the building; Lenotre, the designer of the gardens; and
      Lebrun, the decorator of the apartments. If the Chateau de Vaux possessed
      a single fault with which it could be reproached, it was its grand,
      pretentious character. It is even at the present day proverbial to
      calculate the number of acres of roofing, the restoration of which would,
      in our age, be the ruin of fortunes cramped and narrowed as the epoch
      itself. Vaux-le-Vicomte, when its magnificent gates, supported by
      caryatides, have been passed through, has the principal front of the main
      building opening upon a vast, so-called, court of honor, inclosed by deep
      ditches, bordered by a magnificent stone balustrade. Nothing could be more
      noble in appearance than the central forecourt raised upon the flight of
      steps, like a king upon his throne, having around it four pavilions at the
      angles, the immense Ionic columns of which rose majestically to the whole
      height of the building. The friezes ornamented with arabesques, and the
      pediments which crowned the pilasters, conferred richness and grace on
      every part of the building, while the domes which surmounted the whole
      added proportion and majesty. This mansion, built by a subject, bore a far
      greater resemblance to those royal residences which Wolsey fancied he was
      called upon to construct, in order to present them to his master from the
      fear of rendering him jealous. But if magnificence and splendor were
      displayed in any one particular part of this palace more than another,&mdash;if
      anything could be preferred to the wonderful arrangement of the interior,
      to the sumptuousness of the gilding, and to the profusion of the paintings
      and statues, it would be the park and gardens of Vaux. The <i>jets d&rsquo;eau</i>,
      which were regarded as wonderful in 1653, are still so, even at the
      present time; the cascades awakened the admiration of kings and princes;
      and as for the famous grotto, the theme of so many poetical effusions, the
      residence of that illustrious nymph of Vaux, whom Pelisson made converse
      with La Fontaine, we must be spared the description of all its beauties.
      We will do as Despreaux did,&mdash;we will enter the park, the trees of
      which are of eight years&rsquo; growth only&mdash;that is to say, in their
      present position&mdash;and whose summits even yet, as they proudly tower
      aloft, blushingly unfold their leaves to the earliest rays of the rising
      sun. Lenotre had hastened the pleasure of the Maecenas of his period; all
      the nursery-grounds had furnished trees whose growth had been accelerated
      by careful culture and the richest plant-food. Every tree in the
      neighborhood which presented a fair appearance of beauty or stature had
      been taken up by its roots and transplanted to the park. Fouquet could
      well afford to purchase trees to ornament his park, since he had bought up
      three villages and their appurtenances (to use a legal word) to increase
      its extent. M. de Scudery said of this palace, that, for the purpose of
      keeping the grounds and gardens well watered, M. Fouquet had divided a
      river into a thousand fountains, and gathered the waters of a thousand
      fountains into torrents. This same Monsieur de Scudery said a great many
      other things in his &ldquo;Clelie,&rdquo; about this palace of Valterre, the charms of
      which he describes most minutely. We should be far wiser to send our
      curious readers to Vaux to judge for themselves, than to refer them to
      &ldquo;Clelie;&rdquo; and yet there are as many leagues from Paris to Vaux, as there
      are volumes of the &ldquo;Clelie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This magnificent palace had been got ready for the reception of the
      greatest reigning sovereign of the time. M. Fouquet&rsquo;s friends had
      transported thither, some their actors and their dresses, others their
      troops of sculptors and artists; not forgetting others with their
      ready-mended pens,&mdash;floods of impromptus were contemplated. The
      cascades, somewhat rebellious nymphs though they were, poured forth their
      waters brighter and clearer than crystal: they scattered over the bronze
      triton and nereids their waves of foam, which glistened like fire in the
      rays of the sun. An army of servants were hurrying to and fro in squadrons
      in the courtyard and corridors; while Fouquet, who had only that morning
      arrived, walked all through the palace with a calm, observant glance, in
      order to give his last orders, after his intendants had inspected
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, as we have said, the 15th of August. The sun poured down its
      burning rays upon the heathen deities of marble and bronze: it raised the
      temperature of the water in the conch shells, and ripened, on the walls,
      those magnificent peaches, of which the king, fifty years later, spoke so
      regretfully, when, at Marly, on an occasion of a scarcity of the finer
      sorts of peaches being complained of, in the beautiful gardens there&mdash;gardens
      which had cost France double the amount that had been expended on Vaux&mdash;the
      <i>great king</i> observed to some one: &ldquo;You are far too young to have
      eaten any of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s peaches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, fame! Oh, blazon of renown! Oh, glory of this earth! That very man
      whose judgment was so sound and accurate where merit was concerned&mdash;he
      who had swept into his coffers the inheritance of Nicholas Fouquet, who
      had robbed him of Lenotre and Lebrun, and had sent him to rot for the
      remainder of his life in one of the state prisons&mdash;merely remembered
      the peaches of that vanquished, crushed, forgotten enemy! It was to little
      purpose that Fouquet had squandered thirty millions of francs in the
      fountains of his gardens, in the crucibles of his sculptors, in the
      writing-desks of his literary friends, in the portfolios of his painters;
      vainly had he fancied that thereby he might be remembered. A peach&mdash;a
      blushing, rich-flavored fruit, nestling in the trellis work on the
      garden-wall, hidden beneath its long, green leaves,&mdash;this little
      vegetable production, that a dormouse would nibble up without a thought,
      was sufficient to recall to the memory of this great monarch the mournful
      shade of the last surintendant of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a perfect reliance that Aramis had made arrangements fairly to
      distribute the vast number of guests throughout the palace, and that he
      had not omitted to attend to any of the internal regulations for their
      comfort, Fouquet devoted his entire attention to the <i>ensemble</i>
      alone. In one direction Gourville showed him the preparations which had
      been made for the fireworks; in another, Moliere led him over the theater;
      at last, after he had visited the chapel, the <i>salons</i>, and the
      galleries, and was again going downstairs, exhausted with fatigue, Fouquet
      saw Aramis on the staircase. The prelate beckoned to him. The surintendant
      joined his friend, and, with him, paused before a large picture scarcely
      finished. Applying himself, heart and soul, to his work, the painter
      Lebrun, covered with perspiration, stained with paint, pale from fatigue
      and the inspiration of genius, was putting the last finishing touches with
      his rapid brush. It was the portrait of the king, whom they were
      expecting, dressed in the court suit which Percerin had condescended to
      show beforehand to the bishop of Vannes. Fouquet placed himself before
      this portrait, which seemed to live, as one might say, in the cool
      freshness of its flesh, and in its warmth of color. He gazed upon it long
      and fixedly, estimated the prodigious labor that had been bestowed upon
      it, and, not being able to find any recompense sufficiently great for this
      Herculean effort, he passed his arm round the painter&rsquo;s neck and embraced
      him. The surintendant, by this action, had utterly ruined a suit of
      clothes worth a thousand pistoles, but he had satisfied, more than
      satisfied, Lebrun. It was a happy moment for the artist; it was an unhappy
      moment for M. Percerin, who was walking behind Fouquet, and was engaged in
      admiring, in Lebrun&rsquo;s painting, the suit that he had made for his majesty,
      a perfect <i>objet d&rsquo;art</i>, as he called it, which was not to be matched
      except in the wardrobe of the surintendant. His distress and his
      exclamations were interrupted by a signal which had been given from the
      summit of the mansion. In the direction of Melun, in the still empty, open
      plain, the sentinels of Vaux had just perceived the advancing procession
      of the king and the queens. His majesty was entering Melun with his long
      train of carriages and cavaliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour&mdash;&rdquo; said Aramis to Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour!&rdquo; replied the latter, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the people who ask one another what is the good of these royal <i>fetes!</i>&rdquo;
       continued the bishop of Vannes, laughing, with his false smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I, too, who am not the people, ask myself the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer you in four and twenty hours, monseigneur. Assume a
      cheerful countenance, for it should be a day of true rejoicing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, believe me or not, as you like, D&rsquo;Herblay,&rdquo; said the surintendant,
      with a swelling heart, pointing at the <i>cortege</i> of Louis, visible in
      the horizon, &ldquo;he certainly loves me but very little, and I do not care
      much more for him; but I cannot tell you how it is, that since he is
      approaching my house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since I know he is on his way here, as my guest, he is more sacred
      than ever for me; he is my acknowledged sovereign, and as such is very
      dear to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear? yes,&rdquo; said Aramis, playing upon the word, as the Abbe Terray did,
      at a later period, with Louis XV.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not laugh, D&rsquo;Herblay; I feel that, if he really seemed to wish it, I
      could love that young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not say that to me,&rdquo; returned Aramis, &ldquo;but rather to M.
      Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To M. Colbert!&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet. &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he would allow you a pension out of the king&rsquo;s privy purse, as
      soon as he becomes surintendant,&rdquo; said Aramis, preparing to leave as soon
      as he had dealt this last blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; returned Fouquet, with a gloomy look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my own apartment, in order to change my costume, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereabouts are you lodging, D&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the blue room on the second story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room immediately over the king&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be subject to very great restraint there. What an idea to
      condemn yourself to a room where you cannot stir or move about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the night, monseigneur, I sleep or read in my bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have but one attendant with me. I find my reader quite sufficient.
      Adieu, monseigneur; do not overfatigue yourself; keep yourself fresh for
      the arrival of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see you by and by, I suppose, and shall see your friend Du
      Vallon also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is lodging next to me, and is at this moment dressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Fouquet, bowing, with a smile, passed on like a commander-in-chief who
      pays the different outposts a visit after the enemy has been signaled in
      sight. <a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>

    <h2>
      Chapter XII. The Wine of Melun.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king had, in point of fact, entered Melun with the intention of merely
      passing through the city. The youthful monarch was most eagerly anxious
      for amusements; only twice during the journey had he been able to catch a
      glimpse of La Valliere, and, suspecting that his only opportunity of
      speaking to her would be after nightfall, in the gardens, and after the
      ceremonial of reception had been gone through, he had been very desirous
      to arrive at Vaux as early as possible. But he reckoned without his
      captain of the musketeers, and without M. Colbert. Like Calypso, who could
      not be consoled at the departure of Ulysses, our Gascon could not console
      himself for not having guessed why Aramis had asked Percerin to show him
      the king&rsquo;s new costumes. &ldquo;There is not a doubt,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;that
      my friend the bishop of Vannes had some motive in that;&rdquo; and then he began
      to rack his brains most uselessly. D&rsquo;Artagnan, so intimately acquainted
      with all the court intrigues, who knew the position of Fouquet better than
      even Fouquet himself did, had conceived the strangest fancies and
      suspicions at the announcement of the <i>fete</i>, which would have ruined
      a wealthy man, and which became impossible, utter madness even, for a man
      so poor as he was. And then, the presence of Aramis, who had returned from
      Belle-Isle, and been nominated by Monsieur Fouquet inspector-general of
      all the arrangements; his perseverance in mixing himself up with all the
      surintendant&rsquo;s affairs; his visits to Baisemeaux; all this suspicious
      singularity of conduct had excessively troubled and tormented D&rsquo;Artagnan
      during the last two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With men of Aramis&rsquo;s stamp,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one is never the stronger except
      sword in hand. So long as Aramis continued a soldier, there was hope of
      getting the better of him; but since he has covered his cuirass with a
      stole, we are lost. But what can Aramis&rsquo;s object possibly be?&rdquo; And
      D&rsquo;Artagnan plunged again into deep thought. &ldquo;What does it matter to me,
      after all,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if his only object is to overthrow M. Colbert?
      And what else can he be after?&rdquo; And D&rsquo;Artagnan rubbed his forehead&mdash;that
      fertile land, whence the plowshare of his nails had turned up so many and
      such admirable ideas in his time. He, at first, thought of talking the
      matter over with Colbert, but his friendship for Aramis, the oath of
      earlier days, bound him too strictly. He revolted at the bare idea of such
      a thing, and, besides, he hated the financier too cordially. Then, again,
      he wished to unburden his mind to the king; but yet the king would not be
      able to understand the suspicions which had not even a shadow of reality
      at their base. He resolved to address himself to Aramis, direct, the first
      time he met him. &ldquo;I will get him,&rdquo; said the musketeer, &ldquo;between a couple
      of candles, suddenly, and when he least expects it, I will place my hand
      upon his heart, and he will tell me&mdash;What will he tell me? Yes, he
      will tell me something, for <i>mordioux!</i> there is something in it, I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat calmer, D&rsquo;Artagnan made every preparation for the journey, and
      took the greatest care that the military household of the king, as yet
      very inconsiderable in numbers, should be well officered and well
      disciplined in its meager and limited proportions. The result was that,
      through the captain&rsquo;s arrangements, the king, on arriving at Melun, saw
      himself at the head of both the musketeers and Swiss guards, as well as a
      picket of the French guards. It might almost have been called a small
      army. M. Colbert looked at the troops with great delight: he even wished
      they had been a third more in number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to show greater honor to M. Fouquet,&rdquo; replied Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to ruin him the sooner,&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this little army appeared before Melun, the chief magistrates came
      out to meet the king, and to present him with the keys of the city, and
      invited him to enter the Hotel de Ville, in order to partake of the wine
      of honor. The king, who expected to pass through the city and to proceed
      to Vaux without delay, became quite red in the face from vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was fool enough to occasion this delay?&rdquo; muttered the king, between
      his teeth, as the chief magistrate was in the middle of a long address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, certainly,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;but I believe it was M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert, having heard his name pronounced, said, &ldquo;What was M. d&rsquo;Artagnan
      good enough to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was good enough to remark that it was you who stopped the king&rsquo;s
      progress, so that he might taste the <i>vin de Brie</i>. Was I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, then, it was you whom the king called some name or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know; but wait a moment&mdash;idiot, I think it was&mdash;no,
      no, it was fool or dolt. Yes; his majesty said that the man who had
      thought of the <i>vin de Melun</i> was something of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, after this broadside, quietly caressed his mustache; M.
      Colbert&rsquo;s large head seemed to become larger and larger than ever.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, seeing how ugly anger made him, did not stop half-way. The
      orator still went on with his speech, while the king&rsquo;s color was visibly
      increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordioux!</i>&rdquo; said the musketeer, coolly, &ldquo;the king is going to have
      an attack of determination of blood to the head. Where the deuce did you
      get hold of that idea, Monsieur Colbert? You have no luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the financier, drawing himself up, &ldquo;my zeal for the
      king&rsquo;s service inspired me with the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, Melun is a city, an excellent city, which pays well, and which
      it would be imprudent to displease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now! I, who do not pretend to be a financier, saw only one idea in
      your idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of causing a little annoyance to M. Fouquet, who is making himself
      quite giddy on his donjons yonder, in waiting for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a home-stroke, hard enough in all conscience. Colbert was
      completely thrown out of the saddle by it, and retired, thoroughly
      discomfited. Fortunately, the speech was now at an end; the king drank the
      wine which was presented to him, and then every one resumed the progress
      through the city. The king bit his lips in anger, for the evening was
      closing in, and all hope of a walk with La Valliere was at an end. In
      order that the whole of the king&rsquo;s household should enter Vaux, four hours
      at least were necessary, owing to the different arrangements. The king,
      therefore, who was boiling with impatience, hurried forward as much as
      possible, in order to reach it before nightfall. But, at the moment he was
      setting off again, other and fresh difficulties arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not the king going to sleep at Melun?&rdquo; said Colbert, in a low tone of
      voice, to D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Colbert must have been badly inspired that day, to address himself in
      that manner to the chief of the musketeers; for the latter guessed that
      the king&rsquo;s intention was very far from that of remaining where he was.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux except he were well and
      strongly accompanied; and desired that his majesty would not enter except
      with all the escort. On the other hand, he felt that these delays would
      irritate that impatient monarch beyond measure. In what way could he
      possibly reconcile these difficulties? D&rsquo;Artagnan took up Colbert&rsquo;s
      remark, and determined to repeated it to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not
      intend to sleep at Melun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep at Melun! What for?&rdquo; exclaimed Louis XIV. &ldquo;Sleep at Melun! Who, in
      Heaven&rsquo;s name, can have thought of such a thing, when M. Fouquet is
      expecting us this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was simply,&rdquo; replied Colbert, quickly, &ldquo;the fear of causing your
      majesty the least delay; for, according to established etiquette, you
      cannot enter any place, with the exception of your own royal residences,
      until the soldiers&rsquo; quarters have been marked out by the quartermaster,
      and the garrison properly distributed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan listened with the greatest attention, biting his mustache to
      conceal his vexation; and the queens were not less interested. They were
      fatigued, and would have preferred to go to rest without proceeding any
      farther; more especially, in order to prevent the king walking about in
      the evening with M. de Saint-Aignan and the ladies of the court, for, if
      etiquette required the princesses to remain within their own rooms, the
      ladies of honor, as soon as they had performed the services required of
      them, had no restrictions placed upon them, but were at liberty to walk
      about as they pleased. It will easily be conjectured that all these rival
      interests, gathering together in vapors, necessarily produced clouds, and
      that the clouds were likely to be followed by a tempest. The king had no
      mustache to gnaw, and therefore kept biting the handle of his whip
      instead, with ill-concealed impatience. How could he get out of it?
      D&rsquo;Artagnan looked as agreeable as possible, and Colbert as sulky as he
      could. Who was there he could get in a passion with?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will consult the queen,&rdquo; said Louis XIV., bowing to the royal ladies.
      And this kindness of consideration softened Maria Theresa&rsquo;s heart, who,
      being of a kind and generous disposition, when left to her own free-will,
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to do whatever your majesty wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will it take us to get to Vaux?&rdquo; inquired Anne of Austria, in
      slow and measured accents, placing her hand upon her bosom, where the seat
      of her pain lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour for your majesty&rsquo;s carriages,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;the roads are
      tolerably good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king looked at him. &ldquo;And a quarter of an hour for the king,&rdquo; he
      hastened to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should arrive by daylight?&rdquo; said Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the billeting of the king&rsquo;s military escort,&rdquo; objected Colbert,
      softly, &ldquo;will make his majesty lose all the advantage of his speed,
      however quick he may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Double ass that you are!&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;if I had any interest or
      motive in demolishing your credit with the king, I could do it in ten
      minutes. If I were in the king&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he added aloud, &ldquo;I should, in
      going to M. Fouquet, leave my escort behind me; I should go to him as a
      friend; I should enter accompanied only by my captain of the guards; I
      should consider that I was acting more nobly, and should be invested with
      a still more sacred character by doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delight sparkled in the king&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;That is indeed a very sensible
      suggestion. We will go to see a friend as friends; the gentlemen who are
      with the carriages can go slowly: but we who are mounted will ride on.&rdquo;
       And he rode off, accompanied by all those who were mounted. Colbert hid
      his ugly head behind his horse&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be quits,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he galloped along, &ldquo;by getting a
      little talk with Aramis this evening. And then, M. Fouquet is a man of
      honor. <i>Mordioux!</i> I have said so, and it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was the way how, towards seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, without
      announcing his arrival by the din of trumpets, and without even his
      advanced guard, without out-riders or musketeers, the king presented
      himself before the gate of Vaux, where Fouquet, who had been informed of
      his royal guest&rsquo;s approach, had been waiting for the last half-hour, with
      his head uncovered, surrounded by his household and his friends.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII. Nectar and Ambrosia.
    </h2>
    <p>
      M. Fouquet held the stirrup of the king, who, having dismounted, bowed
      most graciously, and more graciously still held out his hand to him, which
      Fouquet, in spite of a slight resistance on the king&rsquo;s part, carried
      respectfully to his lips. The king wished to wait in the first courtyard
      for the arrival of the carriages, nor had he long to wait, for the roads
      had been put into excellent order by the superintendent, and a stone would
      hardly have been found of the size of an egg the whole way from Melun to
      Vaux; so that the carriages, rolling along as though on a carpet, brought
      the ladies to Vaux, without jolting or fatigue, by eight o&rsquo;clock. They
      were received by Madame Fouquet, and at the moment they made their
      appearance, a light as bright as day burst forth from every quarter,
      trees, vases, and marble statues. This species of enchantment lasted until
      their majesties had retired into the palace. All these wonders and magical
      effects which the chronicler has heaped up, or rather embalmed, in his
      recital, at the risk of rivaling the brain-born scenes of romancers; these
      splendors whereby night seemed vanquished and nature corrected, together
      with every delight and luxury combined for the satisfaction of all the
      senses, as well as the imagination, Fouquet did in real truth offer to his
      sovereign in that enchanting retreat of which no monarch could at that
      time boast of possessing an equal. We do not intend to describe the grand
      banquet, at which the royal guests were present, nor the concerts, nor the
      fairy-like and more than magic transformations and metamorphoses; it will
      be enough for our purpose to depict the countenance the king assumed,
      which, from being gay, soon wore a very gloomy, constrained, and irritated
      expression. He remembered his own residence, royal though it was, and the
      mean and indifferent style of luxury that prevailed there, which comprised
      but little more than what was merely useful for the royal wants, without
      being his own personal property. The large vases of the Louvre, the older
      furniture and plate of Henry II., of Francis I., and of Louis XI., were
      but historic monuments of earlier days; nothing but specimens of art, the
      relics of his predecessors; while with Fouquet, the value of the article
      was as much in the workmanship as in the article itself. Fouquet ate from
      a gold service, which artists in his own employ had modeled and cast for
      him alone. Fouquet drank wines of which the king of France did not even
      know the name, and drank them out of goblets each more valuable than the
      entire royal cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, too, was to be said of the apartments, the hangings, the pictures,
      the servants and officers, of every description, of his household? What of
      the mode of service in which etiquette was replaced by order; stiff
      formality by personal, unrestrained comfort; the happiness and contentment
      of the guest became the supreme law of all who obeyed the host? The
      perfect swarm of busily engaged persons moving about noiselessly; the
      multitude of guests,&mdash;who were, however, even less numerous than the
      servants who waited on them,&mdash;the myriad of exquisitely prepared
      dishes, of gold and silver vases; the floods of dazzling light, the masses
      of unknown flowers of which the hot-houses had been despoiled, redundant
      with luxuriance of unequaled scent and beauty; the perfect harmony of the
      surroundings, which, indeed, was no more than the prelude of the promised
      <i>fete</i>, charmed all who were there; and they testified their
      admiration over and over again, not by voice or gesture, but by deep
      silence and rapt attention, those two languages of the courtier which
      acknowledge the hand of no master powerful enough to restrain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the king, his eyes filled with tears; he dared not look at the
      queen. Anne of Austria, whose pride was superior to that of any creature
      breathing, overwhelmed her host by the contempt with which she treated
      everything handed to her. The young queen, kind-hearted by nature and
      curious by disposition, praised Fouquet, ate with an exceedingly good
      appetite, and asked the names of the strange fruits as they were placed
      upon the table. Fouquet replied that he was not aware of their names. The
      fruits came from his own stores; he had often cultivated them himself,
      having an intimate acquaintance with the cultivation of exotic fruits and
      plants. The king felt and appreciated the delicacy of the replies, but was
      only the more humiliated; he thought the queen a little too familiar in
      her manners, and that Anne of Austria resembled Juno a little too much, in
      being too proud and haughty; his chief anxiety, however, was himself, that
      he might remain cold and distant in his behavior, bordering lightly the
      limits of supreme disdain or simple admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fouquet had foreseen all this; he was, in fact, one of those men who
      foresee everything. The king had expressly declared that, so long as he
      remained under Fouquet&rsquo;s roof, he did not wish his own different repasts
      to be served in accordance with the usual etiquette, and that he would,
      consequently, dine with the rest of society; but by the thoughtful
      attention of the surintendant, the king&rsquo;s dinner was served up separately,
      if one may so express it, in the middle of the general table; the dinner,
      wonderful in every respect, from the dishes of which was composed,
      comprised everything the king liked and generally preferred to anything
      else. Louis had no excuse&mdash;he, indeed, who had the keenest appetite
      in his kingdom&mdash;for saying that he was not hungry. Nay, M. Fouquet
      did even better still; he certainly, in obedience to the king&rsquo;s expressed
      desire, seated himself at the table, but as soon as the soups were served,
      he arose and personally waited on the king, while Madame Fouquet stood
      behind the queen-mother&rsquo;s armchair. The disdain of Juno and the sulky fits
      of temper of Jupiter could not resist this excess of kindly feeling and
      polite attention. The queen ate a biscuit dipped in a glass of San-Lucar
      wine; and the king ate of everything, saying to M. Fouquet: &ldquo;It is
      impossible, monsieur le surintendant, to dine better anywhere.&rdquo; Whereupon
      the whole court began, on all sides, to devour the dishes spread before
      them with such enthusiasm that it looked as though a cloud of Egyptian
      locusts was settling down on green and growing crops.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, however, as his hunger was appeased, the king became morose and
      overgloomed again; the more so in proportion to the satisfaction he
      fancied he had previously manifested, and particularly on account of the
      deferential manner which his courtiers had shown towards Fouquet.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, who ate a good deal and drank but little, without allowing it
      to be noticed, did not lose a single opportunity, but made a great number
      of observations which he turned to good profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the supper was finished, the king expressed a wish not to lose the
      promenade. The park was illuminated; the moon, too, as if she had placed
      herself at the orders of the lord of Vaux, silvered the trees and lake
      with her own bright and quasi-phosphorescent light. The air was strangely
      soft and balmy; the daintily shell-gravelled walks through the thickly set
      avenues yielded luxuriously to the feet. The <i>fete</i> was complete in
      every respect, for the king, having met La Valliere in one of the winding
      paths of the wood, was able to press her hand and say, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo;
       without any one overhearing him except M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, who followed, and M.
      Fouquet, who preceded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreamy night of magical enchantments stole smoothly on. The king
      having requested to be shown to his room, there was immediately a movement
      in every direction. The queens passed to their own apartments, accompanied
      by them music of theorbos and lutes; the king found his musketeers
      awaiting him on the grand flight of steps, for M. Fouquet had brought them
      on from Melun and had invited them to supper. D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s suspicions at
      once disappeared. He was weary, he had supped well, and wished, for once
      in his life, thoroughly to enjoy a <i>fete</i> given by a man who was in
      every sense of the word a king. &ldquo;M. Fouquet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the man for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was conducted with the greatest ceremony to the chamber of
      Morpheus, of which we owe some cursory description to our readers. It was
      the handsomest and largest in the palace. Lebrun had painted on the
      vaulted ceiling the happy as well as the unhappy dreams which Morpheus
      inflicts on kings as well as on other men. Everything that sleep gives
      birth to that is lovely, its fairy scenes, its flowers and nectar, the
      wild voluptuousness or profound repose of the senses, had the painter
      elaborated on his frescoes. It was a composition as soft and pleasing in
      one part as dark and gloomy and terrible in another. The poisoned chalice,
      the glittering dagger suspended over the head of the sleeper; wizards and
      phantoms with terrific masks, those half-dim shadows more alarming than
      the approach of fire or the somber face of midnight, these, and such as
      these, he had made the companions of his more pleasing pictures. No sooner
      had the king entered his room than a cold shiver seemed to pass through
      him, and on Fouquet asking him the cause of it, the king replied, as pale
      as death:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sleepy, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have to talk with a few persons first,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Will you
      have the goodness to tell M. Colbert I wish to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet bowed and left the room.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIV. A Gascon, and a Gascon and a Half.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had determined to lose no time, and in fact he never was in the
      habit of doing so. After having inquired for Aramis, he had looked for him
      in every direction until he had succeeded in finding him. Besides, no
      sooner had the king entered Vaux, than Aramis had retired to his own room,
      meditating, doubtless, some new piece of gallant attention for his
      majesty&rsquo;s amusement. D&rsquo;Artagnan desired the servants to announce him, and
      found on the second story (in a beautiful room called the Blue Chamber, on
      account of the color of its hangings) the bishop of Vannes in company with
      Porthos and several of the modern Epicureans. Aramis came forward to
      embrace his friend, and offered him the best seat. As it was after awhile
      generally remarked among those present that the musketeer was reserved,
      and wished for an opportunity for conversing secretly with Aramis, the
      Epicureans took their leave. Porthos, however, did not stir; for true it
      is that, having dined exceedingly well, he was fast asleep in his
      armchair; and the freedom of conversation therefore was not interrupted by
      a third person. Porthos had a deep, harmonious snore, and people might
      talk in the midst of its loud bass without fear of disturbing him.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan felt that he was called upon to open the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so we have come to Vaux,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, D&rsquo;Artagnan. And how do you like the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, and I like M. Fouquet, also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not a charming host?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could be more so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am told that the king began by showing great distance of manner towards
      M. Fouquet, but that his majesty grew much more cordial afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not notice it, then, since you say you have been told so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was engaged with the gentlemen who have just left the room about
      the theatrical performances and the tournaments which are to take place
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed! you are the comptroller-general of the <i>fetes</i> here,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am a friend of all kinds of amusement where the exercise of
      the imagination is called into activity; I have always been a poet in one
      way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember the verses you used to write, they were charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten them, but I am delighted to read the verses of others,
      when those others are known by the names of Moliere, Pelisson, La
      Fontaine, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what idea occurred to me this evening, Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; tell me what it was, for I should never be able to guess it, you have
      so many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the idea occurred to me, that the true king of France is not Louis
      XIV.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo; said Aramis, involuntarily, looking the musketeer full in
      the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is Monsieur Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis breathed again, and smiled. &ldquo;Ah! you are like all the rest,
      jealous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would wager that it was M. Colbert who turned that
      pretty phrase.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan, in order to throw Aramis off his guard,
      related Colbert&rsquo;s misadventures with regard to the <i>vin de Melun</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes of a mean race, does Colbert,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I think, too,&rdquo; added the bishop, &ldquo;that that fellow will be your
      minister within four months, and that you will serve him as blindly as you
      did Richelieu or Mazarin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as you serve M. Fouquet,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this difference, though, that M. Fouquet is not M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he pretended to become sad and full of
      reflection; and then, a moment after, he added, &ldquo;Why do you tell me that
      M. Colbert will be minister in four months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because M. Fouquet will have ceased to be so,&rdquo; replied Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be ruined, you mean?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Completely so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he give these <i>fetes</i>, then?&rdquo; said the musketeer, in a tone
      so full of thoughtful consideration, and so well assumed, that the bishop
      was for the moment deceived by it. &ldquo;Why did you not dissuade him from it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of the phrase was just a little too much, and Aramis&rsquo;s
      former suspicions were again aroused. &ldquo;It is done with the object of
      humoring the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By ruining himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by ruining himself for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most eccentric, one might say, sinister calculation, that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessity, necessity, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that, dear Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not? Have you not remarked M. Colbert&rsquo;s daily increasing
      antagonism, and that he is doing his utmost to drive the king to get rid
      of the superintendent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must be blind not to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that a cabal is already armed against M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What likelihood is there that the king would join a party formed against
      a man who will have spent everything he had to please him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, slowly, hardly convinced, yet curious to
      broach another phase of the conversation. &ldquo;There are follies, and
      follies,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;and I do not like those you are committing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you allude to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the banquet, the ball, the concert, the theatricals, the
      tournaments, the cascades, the fireworks, the illuminations, and the
      presents&mdash;these are well and good, I grant; but why were not these
      expenses sufficient? Why was it necessary to have new liveries and
      costumes for your whole household?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right. I told M. Fouquet that myself; he replied, that if
      he were rich enough he would offer the king a newly erected chateau, from
      the vanes at the houses to the very sub-cellars; completely new inside and
      out; and that, as soon as the king had left, he would burn the whole
      building and its contents, in order that it might not be made use of by
      any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How completely Spanish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him so, and he then added this: &lsquo;Whoever advises me to spare
      expense, I shall look upon as my enemy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is positive madness; and that portrait, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What portrait?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of the king, and the surprise as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The surprise you seem to have in view, and on account of which you took
      some specimens away, when I met you at Percerin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan paused. The
      shaft was discharged, and all he had to do was to wait and watch its
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is merely an act of graceful attention,&rdquo; replied Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan went up to his friend, took hold of both his hands, and looking
      him full in the eyes, said, &ldquo;Aramis, do you still care for me a very
      little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question to ask!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. One favor, then. Why did you take some patterns of the king&rsquo;s
      costumes at Percerin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me and ask poor Lebrun, who has been working upon them for the
      last two days and nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis, that may be truth for everybody else, but for me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, D&rsquo;Artagnan, you astonish me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a little considerate. Tell me the exact truth; you would not like
      anything disagreeable to happen to me, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, you are becoming quite incomprehensible. What suspicion
      can you have possibly got hold of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in my instinctive feelings? Formerly you used to have
      faith in them. Well, then, an instinct tells me that you have some
      concealed project on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;a project?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not only sure of it, but I would even swear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, D&rsquo;Artagnan, you cause me the greatest pain. Is it likely, if I
      have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you, I should
      tell you about it? If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed,
      should I not have long ago divulged it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Aramis, no. There are certain projects which are never revealed until
      the favorable opportunity arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, my dear fellow,&rdquo; returned the bishop, laughing, &ldquo;the only
      thing now is, that the &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; has not yet arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan shook his head with a sorrowful expression. &ldquo;Oh, friendship,
      friendship!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what an idle word you are! Here is a man who, if I
      were but to ask it, would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Aramis, nobly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this man, who would shed every drop of blood in his veins for me,
      will not open up before me the least corner in his heart. Friendship, I
      repeat, is nothing but an unsubstantial shadow&mdash;a lure, like
      everything else in this bright, dazzling world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not thus you should speak of <i>our</i> friendship,&rdquo; replied the
      bishop, in a firm, assured voice; &ldquo;for ours is not of the same nature as
      those of which you have been speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at us, Aramis; three out of the old &lsquo;four.&rsquo; You are deceiving me; I
      suspect you; and Porthos is fast asleep. An admirable trio of friends,
      don&rsquo;t you think so? What an affecting relic of the former dear old times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only tell you one thing, D&rsquo;Artagnan, and I swear it on the Bible: I
      love you just as I used to do. If I ever suspect you, it is on account of
      others, and not on account of either of us. In everything I may do, and
      should happen to succeed in, you will find your fourth. Will you promise
      me the same favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am not mistaken, Aramis, your words&mdash;at the moment you
      pronounce them&mdash;are full of generous feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a thing is very possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are conspiring against M. Colbert. If that be all, <i>mordioux</i>,
      tell me so at once. I have the instrument in my own hand, and will pull
      out the tooth easily enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis could not conceal a smile of disdain that flitted over his haughty
      features. &ldquo;And supposing that I were conspiring against Colbert, what harm
      would there be in <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; that would be too trifling a matter for you to take in hand, and
      it was not on that account you asked Percerin for those patterns of the
      king&rsquo;s costumes. Oh! Aramis, we are not enemies, remember&mdash;we are
      brothers. Tell me what you wish to undertake, and, upon the word of a
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, if I cannot help you, I will swear to remain neuter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am undertaking nothing,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis, a voice within me speaks and seems to trickle forth a rill of
      light within my darkness: it is a voice that has never yet deceived me. It
      is the king you are conspiring against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king?&rdquo; exclaimed the bishop, pretending to be annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your face will not convince me; the king, I repeat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you help me?&rdquo; said Aramis, smiling ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis, I will do more than help you&mdash;I will do more than remain
      neuter&mdash;I will save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad, D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the wiser of the two, in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You to suspect me of wishing to assassinate the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who spoke of such a thing?&rdquo; smiled the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us understand one another. I do not see what any one can do to
      a legitimate king as ours is, if he does not assassinate him.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan
      did not say a word. &ldquo;Besides, you have your guards and your musketeers
      here,&rdquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in M. Fouquet&rsquo;s house, but in your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but in spite of that, Aramis, grant me, for pity&rsquo;s sake, one single
      word of a true friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true friend&rsquo;s word is ever truth itself. If I think of touching, even
      with my finger, the son of Anne of Austria, the true king of this realm of
      France&mdash;if I have not the firm intention of prostrating myself before
      his throne&mdash;if in every idea I may entertain to-morrow, here at Vaux,
      will not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed&mdash;may Heaven&rsquo;s
      lightning blast me where I stand!&rdquo; Aramis had pronounced these words with
      his face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom, where D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      seated with his back towards the alcove, could not suspect that any one
      was lying concealed. The earnestness of his words, the studied slowness
      with which he pronounced them, the solemnity of his oath, gave the
      musketeer the most complete satisfaction. He took hold of both Aramis&rsquo;s
      hands, and shook them cordially. Aramis had endured reproaches without
      turning pale, and had blushed as he listened to words of praise.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, deceived, did him honor; but D&rsquo;Artagnan, trustful and reliant,
      made him feel ashamed. &ldquo;Are you going away?&rdquo; he said, as he embraced him,
      in order to conceal the flush on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Duty summons me. I have to get the watch-word. It seems I am to be
      lodged in the king&rsquo;s ante-room. Where does Porthos sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him away with you, if you like, for he rumbles through his sleepy
      nose like a park of artillery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he does not stay with you, then?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world. He has a chamber to himself, but I don&rsquo;t know
      where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; said the musketeer; from whom this separation of the two
      associates removed his last suspicion, and he touched Porthos lightly on
      the shoulder; the latter replied by a loud yawn. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, D&rsquo;Artagnan, my dear fellow, is that you? What a lucky chance! Oh,
      yes&mdash;true; I have forgotten; I am at the <i>fete</i> at Vaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and your beautiful dress, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Voliere,
      was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;You are walking so heavily you will make the
      flooring give way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the musketeer; &ldquo;this room is above the dome, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I did not choose it for a fencing-room, I assure you,&rdquo; added the
      bishop. &ldquo;The ceiling of the king&rsquo;s room has all the lightness and calm of
      wholesome sleep. Do not forget, therefore, that my flooring is merely the
      covering of his ceiling. Good night, my friends, and in ten minutes I
      shall be asleep myself.&rdquo; And Aramis accompanied them to the door, laughing
      quietly all the while. As soon as they were outside, he bolted the door,
      hurriedly; closed up the chinks of the windows, and then called out,
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&mdash;monseigneur!&rdquo; Philippe made his appearance from the
      alcove, as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions, it seems,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;you recognized M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you called him by his name, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is your captain of musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very devoted to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; replied Philippe, laying a stress upon
      the personal pronoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As faithful as a dog; but he bites sometimes. If D&rsquo;Artagnan does not
      recognize you before <i>the other</i> has disappeared, rely upon
      D&rsquo;Artagnan to the end of the world; for in that case, if he has seen
      nothing, he will keep his fidelity. If he sees, when it is too late, he is
      a Gascon, and will never admit that he has been deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. What are we to do, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit in this folding-chair. I am going to push aside a portion of the
      flooring; you will look through the opening, which answers to one of the
      false windows made in the dome of the king&rsquo;s apartment. Can you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philippe, starting as at the sight of an enemy; &ldquo;I see the
      king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to wish some man to sit down close to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; wait a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the notes and the portraits, my prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colbert sit down in the king&rsquo;s presence!&rdquo; exclaimed Aramis. &ldquo;It is
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked through the opening in the flooring. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Colbert himself. Oh, monseigneur! what can we be going to hear&mdash;and
      what can result from this intimacy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing good for M. Fouquet, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince did not deceive himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that Louis XIV. had sent for Colbert, and Colbert had
      arrived. The conversation began between them by the king according to him
      one of the highest favors that he had ever done; it was true the king was
      alone with his subject. &ldquo;Colbert,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intendant, overcome with delight, for he feared he was about to be
      dismissed, refused this unprecedented honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he accept?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he remains standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us listen, then.&rdquo; And the future king and the future pope listened
      eagerly to the simple mortals they held under their feet, ready to crush
      them when they liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colbert,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you have annoyed me exceedingly to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Very good; I like that answer.  Yes, you knew it, and there was courage
in the doing of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ran the risk of displeasing your majesty, but I risked, also, the
      concealment of your best interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you were afraid of something on <i>my</i> account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, sire, even if it were nothing more than an indigestion,&rdquo; said
      Colbert; &ldquo;for people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the one
      of to-day, unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good living.&rdquo;
       Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest would produce upon the king;
      and Louis XIV., who was the vainest and the most fastidiously delicate man
      in his kingdom, forgave Colbert the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that M. Fouquet has given me too good a meal.
      Tell me, Colbert, where does he get all the money required for this
      enormous expenditure,&mdash;can you tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do know, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be able to prove it with tolerable certainty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily; and to the utmost farthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are very exact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactitude is the principal qualification required in an intendant of
      finances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all are not so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet, therefore, is rich&mdash;very rich, and I suppose every man
      knows he is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one, sire; the living as well as the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean, Monsieur Colbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The living are witnesses of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s wealth,&mdash;they admire and
      applaud the result produced; but the dead, wiser and better informed than
      we are, know how that wealth was obtained&mdash;and they rise up in
      accusation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something to say to me more confidentially, I perceive; do not
      be afraid, we are quite alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience, and
      under the protection of your majesty,&rdquo; said Colbert, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the dead, therefore, were to speak&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do speak sometimes, sire,&mdash;read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Aramis, in the prince&rsquo;s ear, who, close beside him,
      listened without losing a syllable, &ldquo;since you are placed here,
      monseigneur, in order to learn your vocation of a king, listen to a piece
      of infamy&mdash;of a nature truly royal. You are about to be a witness of
      one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and executes.
      Listen attentively,&mdash;you will find your advantage in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince redoubled his attention, and saw Louis XIV. take from Colbert&rsquo;s
      hands a letter the latter held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The late cardinal&rsquo;s handwriting,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty has an excellent memory,&rdquo; replied Colbert, bowing; &ldquo;it is an
      immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to recognize
      handwritings at the first glance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king read Mazarin&rsquo;s letter, and, as its contents are already known to
      the reader, in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de
      Chevreuse and Aramis, nothing further would be learned if we stated them
      here again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite understand,&rdquo; said the king, greatly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty has not acquired the utilitarian habit of checking the
      public accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that it refers to money that had been given to M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirteen millions. A tolerably good sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, these thirteen millions are wanting to balance the total of
      the account. That is what I do not very well understand. How was this
      deficit possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possible I do not say; but there is no doubt about fact that it is really
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the
      accounts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say so, but the registry does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and
      the name of the person with whom it was deposited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your majesty can judge for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the result is, then, that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the
      thirteen millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That results from the accounts, certainly, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and, consequently&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire, in that case, inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given back
      the thirteen millions, he must have appropriated them to his own purpose;
      and with those thirteen millions one could incur four times and a little
      more as much expense, and make four times as great a display, as your
      majesty was able to do at Fontainebleau, where we only spent three
      millions altogether, if you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a blunderer, the <i>souvenir</i> he had evoked was a rather skillfully
      contrived piece of baseness; for by the remembrance of his own <i>fete</i>
      he, for the first time, perceived its inferiority compared with that of
      Fouquet. Colbert received back again at Vaux what Fouquet had given him at
      Fontainebleau, and, as a good financier, returned it with the best
      possible interest. Having once disposed the king&rsquo;s mind in this artful
      way, Colbert had nothing of much importance to detain him. He felt that
      such was the case, for the king, too, had again sunk into a dull and
      gloomy state. Colbert awaited the first words from the king&rsquo;s lips with as
      much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from their place of
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware what is the usual and natural consequence of all this,
      Monsieur Colbert?&rdquo; said the king, after a few moments&rsquo; reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire, I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the fact of the appropriation of the thirteen millions, if it
      can be proved&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean if it were to be declared and certified, M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it will be to-morrow, if your majesty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were we not under M. Fouquet&rsquo;s roof, you were going to say, perhaps,&rdquo;
       replied the king, with something of nobility in his demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is in his own palace wherever he may be&mdash;especially in
      houses which the royal money has constructed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Philippe in a low tone to Aramis, &ldquo;that the architect who
      planned this dome ought, anticipating the use it could be put to at a
      future opportunity, so to have contrived that it might be made to fall
      upon the heads of scoundrels such as M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; replied Aramis; &ldquo;but M. Colbert is so very <i>near the
      king</i> at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, and that would open the succession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of which your younger brother would reap all the advantage, monseigneur.
      But stay, let us keep quiet, and go on listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not have long to listen,&rdquo; said the young prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if I were king, I should make no further reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should wait until to-morrow morning to give myself time for
      reflection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis XIV. at last raised his eyes, and finding Colbert attentively
      waiting for his next remarks, said, hastily, changing the conversation,
      &ldquo;M. Colbert, I perceive it is getting very late, and I shall now retire to
      bed. By to-morrow morning I shall have made up my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sire,&rdquo; returned Colbert, greatly incensed, although he
      restrained himself in the presence of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king made a gesture of adieu, and Colbert withdrew with a respectful
      bow. &ldquo;My attendants!&rdquo; cried the king; and, as they entered the apartment,
      Philippe was about to quit his post of observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment longer,&rdquo; said Aramis to him, with his accustomed gentleness of
      manner; &ldquo;what has just now taken place is only a detail, and to-morrow we
      shall have no occasion to think anything more about it; but the ceremony
      of the king&rsquo;s retiring to rest, the etiquette observed in addressing the
      king, that indeed is of the greatest importance. Learn, sire, and study
      well how you ought to go to bed of a night. Look! look!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XV. Colbert.
    </h2>
    <p>
      History will tell us, or rather history has told us, of the various events
      of the following day, of the splendid <i>fetes</i> given by the
      surintendant to his sovereign. Nothing but amusement and delight was
      allowed to prevail throughout the whole of the following day; there was a
      promenade, a banquet, a comedy to be acted, and a comedy, too, in which,
      to his great amazement, Porthos recognized &ldquo;M. Coquelin de Voliere&rdquo; as one
      of the actors, in the piece called &ldquo;Les Facheux.&rdquo; Full of preoccupation,
      however, from the scene of the previous evening, and hardly recovered from
      the effects of the poison which Colbert had then administered to him, the
      king, during the whole of the day, so brilliant in its effects, so full of
      unexpected and startling novelties, in which all the wonders of the
      &ldquo;Arabian Night&rsquo;s Entertainments&rdquo; seemed to be reproduced for his especial
      amusement&mdash;the king, we say, showed himself cold, reserved, and
      taciturn. Nothing could smooth the frowns upon his face; every one who
      observed him noticed that a deep feeling of resentment, of remote origin,
      increased by slow degrees, as the source becomes a river, thanks to the
      thousand threads of water that increase its body, was keenly alive in the
      depths of the king&rsquo;s heart. Towards the middle of the day only did he
      begin to resume a little serenity of manner, and by that time he had, in
      all probability, made up his mind. Aramis, who followed him step by step
      in his thoughts, as in his walk, concluded that the event he was expecting
      would not be long before it was announced. This time Colbert seemed to
      walk in concert with the bishop of Vannes, and had he received for every
      annoyance which he inflicted on the king a word of direction from Aramis,
      he could not have done better. During the whole of the day the king, who,
      in all probability, wished to free himself from some of the thoughts which
      disturbed his mind, seemed to seek La Valliere&rsquo;s society as actively as he
      seemed to show his anxiety to flee that of M. Colbert or M. Fouquet. The
      evening came. The king had expressed a wish not to walk in the park until
      after cards in the evening. In the interval between supper and the
      promenade, cards and dice were introduced. The king won a thousand
      pistoles, and, having won them, put them in his pocket, and then rose,
      saying, &ldquo;And now, gentlemen, to the park.&rdquo; He found the ladies of the
      court were already there. The king, we have before observed, had won a
      thousand pistoles, and had put them in his pocket; but M. Fouquet had
      somehow contrived to lose ten thousand, so that among the courtiers there
      was still left a hundred and ninety thousand francs&rsquo; profit to divide, a
      circumstance which made the countenances of the courtiers and the officers
      of the king&rsquo;s household the most joyous countenances in the world. It was
      not the same, however, with the king&rsquo;s face; for, notwithstanding his
      success at play, to which he was by no means insensible, there still
      remained a slight shade of dissatisfaction. Colbert was waiting for or
      upon him at the corner of one of the avenues; he was most probably waiting
      there in consequence of a rendezvous which had been given him by the king,
      as Louis XIV., who had avoided him, or who had seemed to avoid him,
      suddenly made him a sign, and they then struck into the depths of the park
      together. But La Valliere, too, had observed the king&rsquo;s gloomy aspect and
      kindling glances; she had remarked this&mdash;and as nothing which lay
      hidden or smoldering in his heart was hidden from the gaze of her
      affection, she understood that this repressed wrath menaced some one; she
      prepared to withstand the current of his vengeance, and intercede like an
      angel of mercy. Overcome by sadness, nervously agitated, deeply distressed
      at having been so long separated from her lover, disturbed at the sight of
      the emotion she had divined, she accordingly presented herself to the king
      with an embarrassed aspect, which in his then disposition of mind the king
      interpreted unfavorably. Then, as they were alone&mdash;nearly alone,
      inasmuch as Colbert, as soon as he perceived the young girl approaching,
      had stopped and drawn back a dozen paces&mdash;the king advanced towards
      La Valliere and took her by the hand. &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said to her,
      &ldquo;should I be guilty of an indiscretion if I were to inquire if you were
      indisposed? for you seem to breathe as if you were oppressed by some
      secret cause of uneasiness, and your eyes are filled with tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, if I be indeed so, and if my eyes are indeed full of tears, I
      am sorrowful only at the sadness which seems to oppress your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sadness? You are mistaken, mademoiselle; no, it is not sadness I
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humiliation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humiliation? oh! sire, what a word for you to use!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, mademoiselle, that wherever I may happen to be, no one else ought
      to be the master. Well, then, look round you on every side, and judge
      whether I am not eclipsed&mdash;I, the king of France&mdash;before the
      monarch of these wide domains. Oh!&rdquo; he continued, clenching his hands and
      teeth, &ldquo;when I think that this king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire?&rdquo; said Louise, terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;That this king is a faithless, unworthy servant, who grows proud
      and self-sufficient upon the strength of property that belongs to me, and
      which he has stolen. And therefore I am about to change this impudent
      minister&rsquo;s <i>fete</i> into sorrow and mourning, of which the nymph of
      Vaux, as the poets say, shall not soon lose the remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! your majesty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mademoiselle, are you about to take M. Fouquet&rsquo;s part?&rdquo; said Louis,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire; I will only ask whether you are well informed. Your majesty has
      more than once learned the value of accusations made at court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis XIV. made a sign for Colbert to approach. &ldquo;Speak, Monsieur Colbert,&rdquo;
       said the young prince, &ldquo;for I almost believe that Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere has need of your assistance before she can put any faith in the
      king&rsquo;s word. Tell mademoiselle what M. Fouquet has done; and you,
      mademoiselle, will perhaps have the kindness to listen. It will not be
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did Louis XIV. insist upon it in such a manner? A very simple reason&mdash;his
      heart was not at rest, his mind was not thoroughly convinced; he imagined
      there lay some dark, hidden, tortuous intrigue behind these thirteen
      millions of francs; and he wished that the pure heart of La Valliere,
      which had revolted at the idea of theft or robbery, should approve&mdash;even
      were it only by a single word&mdash;the resolution he had taken, and
      which, nevertheless, he hesitated before carrying into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, monsieur,&rdquo; said La Valliere to Colbert, who had advanced; &ldquo;speak,
      since the king wishes me to listen to you. Tell me, what is the crime with
      which M. Fouquet is charged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not very heinous, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;a mere abuse of
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, speak, Colbert; and when you have related it, leave us, and go and
      inform M. d&rsquo;Artagnan that I have certain orders to give him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, sire!&rdquo; exclaimed La Valliere; &ldquo;but why send for M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan? I entreat you to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> in order to arrest this haughty, arrogant Titan who, true
      to his menace, threatens to scale my heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest M. Fouquet, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! does that surprise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his own house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? If he be guilty, he is as guilty in his own house as anywhere
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet, who at this moment is ruining himself for his sovereign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain truth, mademoiselle, it seems as if you were defending this
      traitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert began to chuckle silently. The king turned round at the sound of
      this suppressed mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said La Valliere, &ldquo;it is not M. Fouquet I am defending; it is
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! you are defending me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, you would dishonor yourself if you were to give such an order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dishonor myself!&rdquo; murmured the king, turning pale with anger. &ldquo;In plain
      truth, mademoiselle, you show a strange persistence in what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do, sire, my only motive is that of serving your majesty,&rdquo; replied
      the noble-hearted girl: &ldquo;for that I would risk, I would sacrifice my very
      life, without the least reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert seemed inclined to grumble and complain. La Valliere, that timid,
      gentle lamb, turned round upon him, and with a glance like lightning
      imposed silence upon him. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when the king acts well,
      whether, in doing so, he does either myself or those who belong to me an
      injury, I have nothing to say; but were the king to confer a benefit
      either upon me or mine, and if he acted badly, I should tell him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it appears to me, mademoiselle,&rdquo; Colbert ventured to say, &ldquo;that I too
      love the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur, we both love him, but each in a different manner,&rdquo;
       replied La Valliere, with such an accent that the heart of the young king
      was powerfully affected by it. &ldquo;I love him so deeply, that the whole world
      is aware of it; so purely, that the king himself does not doubt my
      affection. He is my king and my master; I am the least of all his
      servants. But whoso touches his honor assails my life. Therefore, I
      repeat, that they dishonor the king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet
      under his own roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert hung down his head, for he felt that the king had abandoned him.
      However, as he bent his head, he murmured, &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I have only one
      word to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say it, then, monsieur; for I would not listen to it. Besides,
      what could you have to tell me? That M. Fouquet has been guilty of certain
      crimes? I believe he has, because the king has said so; and, from the
      moment the king said, &lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; I have no occasion for other lips to
      say, &lsquo;I affirm it.&rsquo; But, were M. Fouquet the vilest of men, I should say
      aloud, &lsquo;M. Fouquet&rsquo;s person is sacred to the king because he is the guest
      of M. Fouquet. Were his house a den of thieves, were Vaux a cave of
      coiners or robbers, his home is sacred, his palace is inviolable, since
      his wife is living in it; and that is an asylum which even executioners
      would not dare to violate.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere paused, and was silent. In spite of himself the king could not
      but admire her; he was overpowered by the passionate energy of her voice;
      by the nobleness of the cause she advocated. Colbert yielded, overcome by
      the inequality of the struggle. At last the king breathed again more
      freely, shook his head, and held out his hand to La Valliere.
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;why do you decide against me? Do you
      know what this wretched fellow will do, if I give him time to breathe
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should he escape, and take to flight?&rdquo; exclaimed Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, it will always remain on record, to the king&rsquo;s eternal
      honor, that he allowed M. Fouquet to flee; and the more guilty he may have
      been, the greater will the king&rsquo;s honor and glory appear, compared with
      such unnecessary misery and shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis kissed La Valliere&rsquo;s hand, as he knelt before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lost,&rdquo; thought Colbert; then suddenly his face brightened up again.
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no, aha, old fox!&mdash;not yet,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while the king, protected from observation by the thick covert of an
      enormous lime, pressed La Valliere to his breast, with all the ardor of
      ineffable affection, Colbert tranquilly fumbled among the papers in his
      pocket-book and drew out of it a paper folded in the form of a letter,
      somewhat yellow, perhaps, but one that must have been most precious, since
      the intendant smiled as he looked at it; he then bent a look, full of
      hatred, upon the charming group which the young girl and the king formed
      together&mdash;a group revealed but for a moment, as the light of the
      approaching torches shone upon it. Louis noticed the light reflected upon
      La Valliere&rsquo;s white dress. &ldquo;Leave me, Louise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for some one is
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, some one is coming,&rdquo; cried Colbert, to
      expedite the young girl&rsquo;s departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise disappeared rapidly among the trees; and then, as the king, who had
      been on his knees before the young girl, was rising from his humble
      posture, Colbert exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! Mademoiselle de la Valliere has let
      something fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A paper&mdash;a letter&mdash;something white; look there, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stooped down immediately and picked up the letter, crumpling it
      in his hand, as he did so; and at the same moment the torches arrived,
      inundating the blackness of the scene with a flood of light as bight as
      day.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVI. Jealousy.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The torches we have just referred to, the eager attention every one
      displayed, and the new ovation paid to the king by Fouquet, arrived in
      time to suspend the effect of a resolution which La Valliere had already
      considerably shaken in Louis XIV.&lsquo;s heart. He looked at Fouquet with a
      feeling almost of gratitude for having given La Valliere an opportunity of
      showing herself so generously disposed, so powerful in the influence she
      exercised over his heart. The moment of the last and greatest display had
      arrived. Hardly had Fouquet conducted the king towards the chateau, when a
      mass of fire burst from the dome of Vaux, with a prodigious uproar,
      pouring a flood of dazzling cataracts of rays on every side, and
      illumining the remotest corners of the gardens. The fireworks began.
      Colbert, at twenty paces from the king, who was surrounded and <i>feted</i>
      by the owner of Vaux, seemed, by the obstinate persistence of his gloomy
      thoughts, to do his utmost to recall Louis&rsquo;s attention, which the
      magnificence of the spectacle was already, in his opinion, too easily
      diverting. Suddenly, just as Louis was on the point of holding it out to
      Fouquet, he perceived in his hand the paper which, as he believed, La
      Valliere had dropped at his feet as she hurried away. The still stronger
      magnet of love drew the young prince&rsquo;s attention towards the <i>souvenir</i>
      of his idol; and, by the brilliant light, which increased momentarily in
      beauty, and drew from the neighboring villages loud cheers of admiration,
      the king read the letter, which he supposed was a loving and tender
      epistle La Valliere had destined for him. But as he read it, a death-like
      pallor stole over his face, and an expression of deep-seated wrath,
      illumined by the many-colored fire which gleamed so brightly, soaringly
      around the scene, produced a terrible spectacle, which every one would
      have shuddered at, could they only have read into his heart, now torn by
      the most stormy and most bitter passions. There was no truce for him now,
      influenced as he was by jealousy and mad passion. From the very moment
      when the dark truth was revealed to him, every gentler feeling seemed to
      disappear; pity, kindness of consideration, the religion of hospitality,
      all were forgotten. In the bitter pang which wrung his heart, he, still
      too weak to hide his sufferings, was almost on the point of uttering a cry
      of alarm, and calling his guards to gather round him. This letter which
      Colbert had thrown down at the king&rsquo;s feet, the reader has doubtlessly
      guessed, was the same that had disappeared with the porter Toby at
      Fontainebleau, after the attempt which Fouquet had made upon La Valliere&rsquo;s
      heart. Fouquet saw the king&rsquo;s pallor, and was far from guessing the evil;
      Colbert saw the king&rsquo;s anger, and rejoiced inwardly at the approach of the
      storm. Fouquet&rsquo;s voice drew the young prince from his wrathful reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, sire?&rdquo; inquired the superintendent, with an
      expression of graceful interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis made a violent effort over himself, as he replied, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid your majesty is suffering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am suffering, and have already told you so, monsieur; but it is
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the king, without waiting for the termination of the fireworks, turned
      towards the chateau. Fouquet accompanied him, and the whole court
      followed, leaving the remains of the fireworks consuming for their own
      amusement. The superintendent endeavored again to question Louis XIV., but
      did not succeed in obtaining a reply. He imagined there had been some
      misunderstanding between Louis and La Valliere in the park, which had
      resulted in a slight quarrel; and that the king, who was not ordinarily
      sulky by disposition, but completely absorbed by his passion for La
      Valliere, had taken a dislike to every one because his mistress had shown
      herself offended with him. This idea was sufficient to console him; he had
      even a friendly and kindly smile for the young king, when the latter
      wished him good night. This, however, was not all the king had to submit
      to; he was obliged to undergo the usual ceremony, which on that evening
      was marked by close adherence to the strictest etiquette. The next day was
      the one fixed for the departure; it was but proper that the guests should
      thank their host, and show him a little attention in return for the
      expenditure of his twelve millions. The only remark, approaching to
      amiability, which the king could find to say to M. Fouquet, as he took
      leave of him, were in these words, &ldquo;M. Fouquet, you shall hear from me. Be
      good enough to desire M. d&rsquo;Artagnan to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the blood of Louis XIV., who had so profoundly dissimulated his
      feelings, boiled in his veins; and he was perfectly willing to order M.
      Fouquet to be put an end to with the same readiness, indeed, as his
      predecessor had caused the assassination of le Marechal d&rsquo;Ancre; and so he
      disguised the terrible resolution he had formed beneath one of those royal
      smiles which, like lightning-flashes, indicated <i>coups d&rsquo;etat</i>.
      Fouquet took the king&rsquo;s hand and kissed it; Louis shuddered throughout his
      whole frame, but allowed M. Fouquet to touch his hand with his lips. Five
      minutes afterwards, D&rsquo;Artagnan, to whom the royal order had been
      communicated, entered Louis XIV.&lsquo;s apartment. Aramis and Philippe were in
      theirs, still eagerly attentive, and still listening with all their ears.
      The king did not even give the captain of the musketeers time to approach
      his armchair, but ran forward to meet him. &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      &ldquo;that no one enters here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sire,&rdquo; replied the captain, whose glance had for a long time
      past analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance. He gave the
      necessary order at the door; but, returning to the king, he said, &ldquo;Is
      there something fresh the matter, your majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men have you here?&rdquo; inquired the king, without making any other
      reply to the question addressed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men have you, I say?&rdquo; repeated the king, stamping upon the
      ground with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; and what others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men will be required to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do what, sire?&rdquo; replied the musketeer, opening his large, calm eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arrest M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan fell back a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arrest M. Fouquet!&rdquo; he burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?&rdquo; exclaimed the king, in
      tones of cold, vindictive passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never say that anything is impossible,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, wounded to
      the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; do it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan turned on his heel, and made his way towards the door; it was
      but a short distance, and he cleared it in half a dozen paces; when he
      reached it he suddenly paused, and said, &ldquo;Your majesty will forgive me,
      but, in order to effect this arrest, I should like written directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose&mdash;and since when has the king&rsquo;s word been
      insufficient for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the word of a king, when it springs from a feeling of anger, may
      possibly change when the feeling changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to set phrases, monsieur; you have another thought besides that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I, at least, have certain thoughts and ideas, which, unfortunately,
      others have not,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan replied, impertinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, in the tempest of his wrath, hesitated, and drew back in the
      face of D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s frank courage, just as a horse crouches on his
      haunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider. &ldquo;What is
      your thought?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, sire,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan: &ldquo;you cause a man to be arrested when you
      are still under his roof; and passion is alone the cause of that. When
      your anger shall have passed, you will regret what you have done; and then
      I wish to be in a position to show you your signature. If that, however,
      should fail to be a reparation, it will at least show us that the king was
      wrong to lose his temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong to lose his temper!&rdquo; cried the king, in a loud, passionate voice.
      &ldquo;Did not my father, my grandfathers, too, before me, lose their temper at
      times, in Heaven&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their
      temper except when under the protection of their own palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is master wherever he may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a flattering, complimentary phrase which cannot proceed from any
      one but M. Colbert; but it happens not to be the truth. The king is at
      home in every man&rsquo;s house when he has driven its owner out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king bit his lips, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;here is a man who is positively
      ruining himself in order to please you, and you wish to have him arrested!
      <i>Mordioux!</i> Sire, if my name was Fouquet, and people treated me in
      that manner, I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of fireworks and
      other things, and I would set fire to them, and send myself and everybody
      else in blown-up atoms to the sky. But it is all the same; it is your
      wish, and it shall be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;but have you men enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me? Arrest M.
      Fouquet! why, that is so easy that a very child might do it! It is like
      drinking a glass of wormwood; one makes an ugly face, and that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he defends himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! it is not at all likely. Defend himself when such extreme harshness
      as you are going to practice makes the man a very martyr! Nay, I am sure
      that if he has a million of francs left, which I very much doubt, he would
      be willing enough to give it in order to have such a termination as this.
      But what does that matter? it shall be done at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;do not make his arrest a public affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be more difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because nothing is easier than to go up to M. Fouquet in the midst of a
      thousand enthusiastic guests who surround him, and say, &lsquo;In the king&rsquo;s
      name, I arrest you.&rsquo; But to go up to him, to turn him first one way and
      then another, to drive him up into one of the corners of the chess-board,
      in such a way that he cannot escape; to take him away from his guests, and
      keep him a prisoner for you, without one of them, alas! having heard
      anything about it; that, indeed, is a genuine difficulty, the greatest of
      all, in truth; and I hardly see how it is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better say it is impossible, and you will have finished much
      sooner. Heaven help me, but I seem to be surrounded by people who prevent
      me doing what I wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not prevent your doing anything. Have you indeed decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of M. Fouquet, until I shall have made up my mind by to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shall be done, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And return, when I rise in the morning, for further orders; and now leave
      me to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not even want M. Colbert, then?&rdquo; said the musketeer, firing his
      last shot as he was leaving the room. The king started. With his whole
      mind fixed on the thought of revenge, he had forgotten the cause and
      substance of the offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no one,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no one here! Leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan quitted the room. The king closed the door with his own hands,
      and began to walk up and down his apartment at a furious pace, like a
      wounded bull in an arena, trailing from his horn the colored streamers and
      the iron darts. At last he began to take comfort in the expression of his
      violent feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable wretch that he is! not only does he squander my finances, but
      with his ill-gotten plunder he corrupts secretaries, friends, generals,
      artists, and all, and tries to rob me of the one to whom I am most
      attached. This is the reason that perfidious girl so boldly took his part!
      Gratitude! and who can tell whether it was not a stronger feeling&mdash;love
      itself?&rdquo; He gave himself up for a moment to the bitterest reflections. &ldquo;A
      satyr!&rdquo; he thought, with that abhorrent hate with which young men regard
      those more advanced in life, who still think of love. &ldquo;A man who has never
      found opposition or resistance in any one, who lavishes his gold and
      jewels in every direction, and who retains his staff of painters in order
      to take the portraits of his mistresses in the costume of goddesses.&rdquo; The
      king trembled with passion as he continued, &ldquo;He pollutes and profanes
      everything that belongs to me! He destroys everything that is mine. He
      will be my death at last, I know. That man is too much for me; he is my
      mortal enemy, but he shall forthwith fall! I hate him&mdash;I hate him&mdash;I
      hate him!&rdquo; and as he pronounced these words, he struck the arm of the
      chair in which he was sitting violently, over and over again, and then
      rose like one in an epileptic fit. &ldquo;To-morrow! to-morrow! oh, happy day!&rdquo;
       he murmured, &ldquo;when the sun rises, no other rival shall that brilliant king
      of space possess but me. That man shall fall so low that when people look
      at the abject ruin my anger shall have wrought, they will be forced to
      confess at last and at least that I am indeed greater than he.&rdquo; The king,
      who was incapable of mastering his emotions any longer, knocked over with
      a blow of his fist a small table placed close to his bedside, and in the
      very bitterness of anger, almost weeping, and half-suffocated, he threw
      himself on his bed, dressed as he was, and bit the sheets in his extremity
      of passion, trying to find repose of body at least there. The bed creaked
      beneath his weight, and with the exception of a few broken sounds,
      emerging, or, one might say, exploding, from his overburdened chest,
      absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of Morpheus.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII. High Treason.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ungovernable fury which took possession of the king at the sight and
      at the perusal of Fouquet&rsquo;s letter to La Valliere by degrees subsided into
      a feeling of pain and extreme weariness. Youth, invigorated by health and
      lightness of spirits, requiring soon that what it loses should be
      immediately restored&mdash;youth knows not those endless, sleepless nights
      which enable us to realize the fable of the vulture unceasingly feeding on
      Prometheus. In cases where the man of middle life, in his acquired
      strength of will and purpose, and the old, in their state of natural
      exhaustion, find incessant augmentation of their bitter sorrow, a young
      man, surprised by the sudden appearance of misfortune, weakens himself in
      sighs, and groans, and tears, directly struggling with his grief, and is
      thereby far sooner overthrown by the inflexible enemy with whom he is
      engaged. Once overthrown, his struggles cease. Louis could not hold out
      more than a few minutes, at the end of which he had ceased to clench his
      hands, and scorch in fancy with his looks the invisible objects of his
      hatred; he soon ceased to attack with his violent imprecations not M.
      Fouquet alone, but even La Valliere herself; from fury he subsided into
      despair, and from despair to prostration. After he had thrown himself for
      a few minutes to and fro convulsively on his bed, his nerveless arms fell
      quietly down; his head lay languidly on his pillow; his limbs, exhausted
      with excessive emotion, still trembled occasionally, agitated by muscular
      contractions; while from his breast faint and infrequent sighs still
      issued. Morpheus, the tutelary deity of the apartment, towards whom Louis
      raised his eyes, wearied by his anger and reconciled by his tears,
      showered down upon him the sleep-inducing poppies with which his hands are
      ever filled; so presently the monarch closed his eyes and fell asleep.
      Then it seemed to him, as it often happens in that first sleep, so light
      and gentle, which raises the body above the couch, and the soul above the
      earth&mdash;it seemed to him, we say, as if the god Morpheus, painted on
      the ceiling, looked at him with eyes resembling human eyes; that something
      shone brightly, and moved to and fro in the dome above the sleeper; that
      the crowd of terrible dreams which thronged together in his brain, and
      which were interrupted for a moment, half revealed a human face, with a
      hand resting against the mouth, and in an attitude of deep and absorbed
      meditation. And strange enough, too, this man bore so wonderful a
      resemblance to the king himself, that Louis fancied he was looking at his
      own face reflected in a mirror; with the exception, however, that the face
      was saddened by a feeling of the profoundest pity. Then it seemed to him
      as if the dome gradually retired, escaping from his gaze, and that the
      figures and attributes painted by Lebrun became darker and darker as the
      distance became more and more remote. A gentle, easy movement, as regular
      as that by which a vessel plunges beneath the waves, had succeeded to the
      immovableness of the bed. Doubtless the king was dreaming, and in this
      dream the crown of gold, which fastened the curtains together, seemed to
      recede from his vision, just as the dome, to which it remained suspended,
      had done, so that the winged genius which, with both its hand, supported
      the crown, seemed, though vainly so, to call upon the king, who was fast
      disappearing from it. The bed still sunk. Louis, with his eyes open, could
      not resist the deception of this cruel hallucination. At last, as the
      light of the royal chamber faded away into darkness and gloom, something
      cold, gloomy, and inexplicable in its nature seemed to infect the air. No
      paintings, nor gold, nor velvet hangings, were visible any longer, nothing
      but walls of a dull gray color, which the increasing gloom made darker
      every moment. And yet the bed still continued to descend, and after a
      minute, which seemed in its duration almost an age to the king, it reached
      a stratum of air, black and chill as death, and then it stopped. The king
      could no longer see the light in his room, except as from the bottom of a
      well we can see the light of day. &ldquo;I am under the influence of some
      atrocious dream,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It is time to awaken from it. Come! let me
      wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one has experienced the sensation the above remark conveys; there is
      hardly a person who, in the midst of a nightmare whose influence is
      suffocating, has not said to himself, by the help of that light which
      still burns in the brain when every human light is extinguished, &ldquo;It is
      nothing but a dream, after all.&rdquo; This was precisely what Louis XIV. said
      to himself; but when he said, &ldquo;Come, come! wake up,&rdquo; he perceived that not
      only was he already awake, but still more, that he had his eyes open also.
      And then he looked all round him. On his right hand and on his left two
      armed men stood in stolid silence, each wrapped in a huge cloak, and the
      face covered with a mask; one of them held a small lamp in his hand, whose
      glimmering light revealed the saddest picture a king could look upon.
      Louis could not help saying to himself that his dream still lasted, and
      that all he had to do to cause it to disappear was to move his arms or to
      say something aloud; he darted from his bed, and found himself upon the
      damp, moist ground. Then, addressing himself to the man who held the lamp
      in his hand, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this, monsieur, and what is the meaning of this jest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no jest,&rdquo; replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the
      lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you belong to M. Fouquet?&rdquo; inquired the king, greatly astonished at
      his situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters very little to whom we belong,&rdquo; said the phantom; &ldquo;we are your
      masters now, that is sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, more impatient than intimidated, turned to the other masked
      figure. &ldquo;If this is a comedy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will tell M. Fouquet that I
      find it unseemly and improper, and that I command it should cease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second masked person to whom the king had addressed himself was a man
      of huge stature and vast circumference. He held himself erect and
      motionless as any block of marble. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; added the king, stamping his
      foot, &ldquo;you do not answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not answer you, my good monsieur,&rdquo; said the giant, in a stentorian
      voice, &ldquo;because there is nothing to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, tell me what you want,&rdquo; exclaimed Louis, folding his arms with
      a passionate gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know by and by,&rdquo; replied the man who held the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime tell me where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis looked all round him; but by the light of the lamp which the masked
      figure raised for the purpose, he could perceive nothing but the damp
      walls which glistened here and there with the slimy traces of the snail.
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh!&mdash;a dungeon,&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a subterranean passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which leads&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be good enough to follow us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not stir from hence!&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are obstinate, my dear young friend,&rdquo; replied the taller of the
      two, &ldquo;I will lift you up in my arms, and roll you up in your own cloak,
      and if you should happen to be stifled, why&mdash;so much the worse for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he disengaged from beneath his cloak a hand of which Milo
      of Crotona would have envied him the possession, on the day when he had
      that unhappy idea of rending his last oak. The king dreaded violence, for
      he could well believe that the two men into whose power he had fallen had
      not gone so far with any idea of drawing back, and that they would
      consequently be ready to proceed to extremities, if necessary. He shook
      his head and said: &ldquo;It seems I have fallen into the hands of a couple of
      assassins. Move on, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the men answered a word to this remark. The one who carried the
      lantern walked first, the king followed him, while the second masked
      figure closed the procession. In this manner they passed along a winding
      gallery of some length, with as many staircases leading out of it as are
      to be found in the mysterious and gloomy palaces of Ann Radcliffe&rsquo;s
      creation. All these windings and turnings, during which the king heard the
      sound of running water <i>over his head</i>, ended at last in a long
      corridor closed by an iron door. The figure with the lamp opened the door
      with one of the keys he wore suspended at his girdle, where, during the
      whole of the brief journey, the king had heard them rattle. As soon as the
      door was opened and admitted the air, Louis recognized the balmy odors
      that trees exhale in hot summer nights. He paused, hesitatingly, for a
      moment or two; but the huge sentinel who followed him thrust him out of
      the subterranean passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another blow,&rdquo; said the king, turning towards the one who had just had
      the audacity to touch his sovereign; &ldquo;what do you intend to do with the
      king of France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to forget that word,&rdquo; replied the man with the lamp, in a tone which
      as little admitted of a reply as one of the famous decrees of Minos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve to be broken on the wheel for the words that you have just
      made use of,&rdquo; said the giant, as he extinguished the lamp his companion
      handed to him; &ldquo;but the king is too kind-hearted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis, at that threat, made so sudden a movement that it seemed as if he
      meditated flight; but the giant&rsquo;s hand was in a moment placed on his
      shoulder, and fixed him motionless where he stood. &ldquo;But tell me, at least,
      where we are going,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; replied the former of the two men, with a kind of respect in his
      manner, and leading his prisoner towards a carriage which seemed to be in
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was completely concealed amid the trees. Two horses, with
      their feet fettered, were fastened by a halter to the lower branches of a
      large oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; said the same man, opening the carriage-door and letting down
      the step. The king obeyed, seated himself at the back of the carriage, the
      padded door of which was shut and locked immediately upon him and his
      guide. As for the giant, he cut the fastenings by which the horses were
      bound, harnessed them himself, and mounted on the box of the carriage,
      which was unoccupied. The carriage set off immediately at a quick trot,
      turned into the road to Paris, and in the forest of Senart found a relay
      of horses fastened to the trees in the same manner the first horses had
      been, and without a postilion. The man on the box changed the horses, and
      continued to follow the road towards Paris with the same rapidity, so that
      they entered the city about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. They carriage
      proceeded along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and, after having called out
      to the sentinel, &ldquo;By the king&rsquo;s order,&rdquo; the driver conducted the horses
      into the circular inclosure of the Bastile, looking out upon the
      courtyard, called La Cour du Gouvernement. There the horses drew up,
      reeking with sweat, at the flight of steps, and a sergeant of the guard
      ran forward. &ldquo;Go and wake the governor,&rdquo; said the coachman in a voice of
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of this voice, which might have been heard at the
      entrance of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, everything remained as calm in the
      carriage as in the prison. Ten minutes afterwards, M. de Baisemeaux
      appeared in his dressing-gown on the threshold of the door. &ldquo;What is the
      matter now?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;and whom have you brought me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the lantern opened the carriage-door, and said two or three
      words to the one who acted as driver, who immediately got down from his
      seat, took up a short musket which he kept under his feet, and placed its
      muzzle on his prisoner&rsquo;s chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fire at once if he speaks!&rdquo; added aloud the man who alighted from the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; replied his companion, without another remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this recommendation, the person who had accompanied the king in the
      carriage ascended the flight of steps, at the top of which the governor
      was awaiting him. &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay!&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Let us go into your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! what brings you here at this hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mistake, my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,&rdquo; Aramis replied, quietly. &ldquo;It
      appears that you were quite right the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; inquired the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the order of release, my dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you mean, monsieur&mdash;no, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the
      governor, almost suffocated by surprise and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very simple affair: you remember, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that an
      order of release was sent to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for Marchiali.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! we both thought that it was for Marchiali?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; you will recollect, however, that I would not credit it, but
      that you compelled me to believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Baisemeaux, my good fellow, what a word to make use of!&mdash;strongly
      recommended, that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strongly recommended, yes; strongly recommended to give him up to you;
      and that you carried him off with you in your carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux, it was a mistake; it was discovered
      at the ministry, so that I now bring you an order from the king to set at
      liberty Seldon,&mdash;that poor Seldon fellow, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seldon! are you sure this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, read it yourself,&rdquo; added Aramis, handing him the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, &ldquo;this order is the very same that has already
      passed through my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the very one I assured you I saw the other evening. <i>Parbleu!</i>
      I recognize it by the blot of ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know whether it is that; but all I know is, that I bring it for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, what about the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marchiali.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got him here with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not enough for me. I require a new order to take him back
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk such nonsense, my dear Baisemeaux; you talk like a child!
      Where is the order you received respecting Marchiali?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux ran to his iron chest and took it out. Aramis seized hold of
      it, coolly tore it in four pieces, held them to the lamp, and burnt them.
      &ldquo;Good heavens! what are you doing?&rdquo; exclaimed Baisemeaux, in an extremity
      of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at your position quietly, my good governor,&rdquo; said Aramis, with
      imperturbable self-possession, &ldquo;and you will see how very simple the whole
      affair is. You no longer possess any order justifying Marchiali&rsquo;s
      release.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a lost man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it, my good fellow, since I have brought Marchiali back to you,
      and all accordingly is just the same as if he had never left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the governor, completely overcome by terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plain enough, you see; and you will go and shut him up immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will hand over this Seldon to me, whose liberation is authorized
      by this order. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do understand, I see,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo; Baisemeaux clapped
      his hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, at all events, after having taken Marchiali away from me, do you
      bring him back again?&rdquo; cried the unhappy governor, in a paroxysm of
      terror, and completely dumbfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a friend such as you are,&rdquo; said Aramis&mdash;&ldquo;for so devoted a
      servant, I have no secrets;&rdquo; and he put his mouth close to Baisemeaux&rsquo;s
      ear, as he said, in a low tone of voice, &ldquo;you know the resemblance between
      that unfortunate fellow, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king?&mdash;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; the first use that Marchiali made of his liberty was to
      persist&mdash;Can you guess what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it likely I should guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To persist in saying that he was king of France; to dress himself up in
      clothes like those of the king; and then pretend to assume that he was the
      king himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the reason why I have brought him back again, my dear friend. He
      is mad and lets every one see how mad he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very simple; let no one hold any communication with him. You
      understand that when his peculiar style of madness came to the king&rsquo;s
      ears, the king, who had pitied his terrible affliction, and saw that all
      his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude, became perfectly
      furious; so that, now&mdash;and remember this very distinctly, dear
      Monsieur de Baisemeaux, for it concerns you most closely&mdash;so that
      there is now, I repeat, sentence of death pronounced against all those who
      may allow him to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself.
      You understand, Baisemeaux, sentence of death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not ask me whether I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, let us go down, and conduct this poor devil back to his dungeon
      again, unless you prefer he should come up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the good of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better, perhaps, to enter his name in the prison-book at
      once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, certainly; not a doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, have him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung, as a
      warning to every one to retire, in order to avoid meeting a prisoner,
      about whom it was desired to observe a certain mystery. Then, when the
      passages were free, he went to take the prisoner from the carriage, at
      whose breast Porthos, faithful to the directions which had been given him,
      still kept his musket leveled. &ldquo;Ah! is that you, miserable wretch?&rdquo; cried
      the governor, as soon as he perceived the king. &ldquo;Very good, very good.&rdquo;
       And immediately, making the king get out of the carriage, he led him,
      still accompanied by Porthos, who had not taken off his mask, and Aramis,
      who again resumed his, up the stairs, to the second Bertaudiere, and
      opened the door of the room in which Philippe for six long years had
      bemoaned his existence. The king entered the cell without pronouncing a
      single word: he faltered in as limp and haggard as a rain-struck lily.
      Baisemeaux shut the door upon him, turned the key twice in the lock, and
      then returned to Aramis. &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone, &ldquo;that
      he bears a striking resemblance to the king; but less so than you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;you would not have been deceived by the
      substitution of the one for the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a most valuable fellow, Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;and now, set
      Seldon free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I was going to forget that. I will go and give orders at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! to-morrow will be time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&mdash;oh, no. This very minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; go off to your affairs, I will go away to mine. But it is quite
      understood, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;is quite understood&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That no one is to enter the prisoner&rsquo;s cell, expect with an order from
      the king; an order which I will myself bring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Adieu, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis returned to his companion. &ldquo;Now, Porthos, my good fellow, back
      again to Vaux, and as fast as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man is light and easy enough, when he has faithfully served his king;
      and, in serving him, saved his country,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;The horses will be
      as light as if our tissues were constructed of the wind of heaven. So let
      us be off.&rdquo; And the carriage, lightened of a prisoner, who might well be&mdash;as
      he in fact was&mdash;very heavy in the sight of Aramis, passed across the
      drawbridge of the Bastile, which was raised again immediately behind it.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVIII. A Night at the Bastile.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pain, anguish, and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the
      strength with which a man is endowed. We will not pretend to say that
      Heaven always apportions to a man&rsquo;s capability of endurance the anguish
      with which he afflicts him; for that, indeed, would not be true, since
      Heaven permits the existence of death, which is, sometimes, the only
      refuge open to those who are too closely pressed&mdash;too bitterly
      afflicted, as far as the body is concerned. Suffering is in proportion to
      the strength which has been accorded; in other words, the weak suffer
      more, where the trial is the same, than the strong. And what are the
      elementary principles, we may ask, that compose human strength? Is it not&mdash;more
      than anything else&mdash;exercise, habit, experience? We shall not even
      take the trouble to demonstrate this, for it is an axiom in morals, as in
      physics. When the young king, stupefied and crushed in every sense and
      feeling, found himself led to a cell in the Bastile, he fancied death
      itself is but a sleep; that it, too, has its dreams as well; that the bed
      had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux; that death had
      resulted from the occurrence; and that, still carrying out his dream, the
      king, Louis XIV., now no longer living, was dreaming one of those horrors,
      impossible to realize in life, which is termed dethronement, imprisonment,
      and insult towards a sovereign who formerly wielded unlimited power. To be
      present at&mdash;an actual witness, too&mdash;of this bitterness of death;
      to float, indecisively, in an incomprehensible mystery, between
      resemblance and reality; to hear everything, to see everything, without
      interfering in a single detail of agonizing suffering, was&mdash;so the
      king thought within himself&mdash;a torture far more terrible, since it
      might last forever. &ldquo;Is this what is termed eternity&mdash;hell?&rdquo; he
      murmured, at the moment the door was closed upon him, which we remember
      Baisemeaux had shut with his own hands. He did not even look round him;
      and in the room, leaning with his back against the wall, he allowed
      himself to be carried away by the terrible supposition that he was already
      dead, as he closed his eyes, in order to avoid looking upon something even
      worse still. &ldquo;How can I have died?&rdquo; he said to himself, sick with terror.
      &ldquo;The bed might have been let down by some artificial means? But no! I do
      not remember to have felt a bruise, nor any shock either. Would they not
      rather have poisoned me at my meals, or with the fumes of wax, as they did
      my ancestress, Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret?&rdquo; Suddenly, the chill of the dungeons
      seemed to fall like a wet cloak upon Louis&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;I have seen,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;my father lying dead upon his funeral couch, in his regal robes.
      That pale face, so calm and worn; those hands, once so skillful, lying
      nerveless by his side; those limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death;
      nothing there betokened a sleep that was disturbed by dreams. And yet, how
      numerous were the dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse&mdash;him
      whom so many others had preceded, hurried away by him into eternal death!
      No, that king was still the king: he was enthroned still upon that funeral
      couch, as upon a velvet armchair; he had not abdicated one title of his
      majesty. God, who had not punished him, cannot, will not punish me, who
      have done nothing.&rdquo; A strange sound attracted the young man&rsquo;s attention.
      He looked round him, and saw on the mantel-shelf, just below an enormous
      crucifix, coarsely painted in fresco on the wall, a rat of enormous size
      engaged in nibbling a piece of dry bread, but fixing all the time, an
      intelligent and inquiring look upon the new occupant of the cell. The king
      could not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust: he moved back
      towards the door, uttering a loud cry; and as if he but needed this cry,
      which escaped from his breast almost unconsciously, to recognize himself,
      Louis knew that he was alive and in full possession of his natural senses.
      &ldquo;A prisoner!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&mdash;I, a prisoner!&rdquo; He looked round him for a
      bell to summon some one to him. &ldquo;There are no bells in the Bastile,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and it is in the Bastile I am imprisoned. In what way can I have
      been made a prisoner? It must have been owing to a conspiracy of M.
      Fouquet. I have been drawn to Vaux, as to a snare. M. Fouquet cannot be
      acting alone in this affair. His agent&mdash;That voice that I but just
      now heard was M. d&rsquo;Herblay&rsquo;s; I recognized it. Colbert was right, then.
      But what is Fouquet&rsquo;s object? To reign in my place and stead?&mdash;Impossible.
      Yet who knows!&rdquo; thought the king, relapsing into gloom again. &ldquo;Perhaps my
      brother, the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans, is doing that which my uncle wished to do
      during the whole of his life against my father. But the queen?&mdash;My
      mother, too? And La Valliere? Oh! La Valliere, she will have been
      abandoned to Madame. Dear, dear girl! Yes, it is&mdash;it must be so. They
      have shut her up as they have me. We are separated forever!&rdquo; And at this
      idea of separation the poor lover burst into a flood of tears and sobs and
      groans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a governor in this place,&rdquo; the king continued, in a fury of
      passion; &ldquo;I will speak to him, I will summon him to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called&mdash;no voice replied to his. He seized hold of his chair, and
      hurled it against the massive oaken door. The wood resounded against the
      door, and awakened many a mournful echo in the profound depths of the
      staircase; but from a human creature, none.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was
      held at the Bastile. Therefore, when his first fit of anger had passed
      away, having remarked a barred window through which there passed a stream
      of light, lozenge-shaped, which must be, he knew, the bright orb of
      approaching day, Louis began to call out, at first gently enough, then
      louder and louder still; but no one replied. Twenty other attempts which
      he made, one after another, obtained no other or better success. His blood
      began to boil within him, and mount to his head. His nature was such,
      that, accustomed to command, he trembled at the idea of disobedience. The
      prisoner broke the chair, which was too heavy for him to lift, and made
      use of it as a battering ram to strike against the door. He struck so
      loudly, and so repeatedly, that the perspiration soon began to pour down
      his face. The sound became tremendous and continuous; certain stifled,
      smothered cries replied in different directions. This sound produced a
      strange effect upon the king. He paused to listen; it was the voice of the
      prisoners, formerly his victims, now his companions. The voices ascended
      like vapors through the thick ceilings and the massive walls, and rose in
      accusations against the author of this noise, as doubtless their sighs and
      tears accused, in whispered tones, the author of their captivity. After
      having deprived so many people of their liberty, the king came among them
      to rob them of their rest. This idea almost drove him mad; it redoubled
      his strength, or rather his will, bent upon obtaining some information, or
      a conclusion to the affair. With a portion of the broken chair he
      recommenced the noise. At the end of an hour, Louis heard something in the
      corridor, behind the door of his cell, and a violent blow, which was
      returned upon the door itself, made him cease his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; said a rude, brutal voice. &ldquo;What is the matter with you
      this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning!&rdquo; thought the king; but he said aloud, politely, &ldquo;Monsieur,
      are you the governor of the Bastile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow, your head is out of sorts,&rdquo; replied the voice; &ldquo;but that
      is no reason why you should make such a terrible disturbance. Be quiet; <i>mordioux!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the governor?&rdquo; the king inquired again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a door on the corridor close; the jailer had just left, not
      condescending to reply a single word. When the king had assured himself of
      his departure, his fury knew no longer any bounds. As agile as a tiger, he
      leaped from the table to the window, and struck the iron bars with all his
      might. He broke a pane of glass, the pieces of which fell clanking into
      the courtyard below. He shouted with increasing hoarseness, &ldquo;The governor,
      the governor!&rdquo; This excess lasted fully an hour, during which time he was
      in a burning fever. With his hair in disorder and matted on his forehead,
      his dress torn and covered with dust and plaster, his linen in shreds, the
      king never rested until his strength was utterly exhausted, and it was not
      until then that he clearly understood the pitiless thickness of the walls,
      the impenetrable nature of the cement, invincible to every influence but
      that of time, and that he possessed no other weapon but despair. He leaned
      his forehead against the door, and let the feverish throbbings of his
      heart calm by degrees; it had seemed as if one single additional pulsation
      would have made it burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment will come when the food which is given to the prisoners will be
      brought to me. I shall then see some one, I shall speak to him, and get an
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the king tried to remember at what hour the first repast of the
      prisoners was served at the Bastile; he was ignorant even of this detail.
      The feeling of remorse at this remembrance smote him like the thrust of a
      dagger, that he should have lived for five and twenty years a king, and in
      the enjoyment of every happiness, without having bestowed a moment&rsquo;s
      thought on the misery of those who had been unjustly deprived of their
      liberty. The king blushed for very shame. He felt that Heaven, in
      permitting this fearful humiliation, did no more than render to the man
      the same torture as had been inflicted by that man upon so many others.
      Nothing could be more efficacious for reawakening his mind to religious
      influences than the prostration of his heart and mind and soul beneath the
      feeling of such acute wretchedness. But Louis dared not even kneel in
      prayer to God to entreat him to terminate his bitter trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven is right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Heaven acts wisely. It would be cowardly to
      pray to Heaven for that which I have so often refused my own
      fellow-creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had reached this stage of his reflections, that is, of his agony of
      mind, when a similar noise was again heard behind his door, followed this
      time by the sound of the key in the lock, and of the bolts being withdrawn
      from their staples. The king bounded forward to be nearer to the person
      who was about to enter, but, suddenly reflecting that it was a movement
      unworthy of a sovereign, he paused, assumed a noble and calm expression,
      which for him was easy enough, and waited with his back turned towards the
      window, in order, to some extent, to conceal his agitation from the eyes
      of the person who was about to enter. It was only a jailer with a basket
      of provisions. The king looked at the man with restless anxiety, and
      waited until he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;you have broken your chair. I said you had done
      so! Why, you have gone quite mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;be careful what you say; it will be a very
      serious affair for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The jailer placed the basket on the table, and looked at his prisoner
      steadily. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desire the governor to come to me,&rdquo; added the king, in accents full of
      calm and dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my boy,&rdquo; said the turnkey, &ldquo;you have always been very quiet and
      reasonable, but you are getting vicious, it seems, and I wish you to know
      it in time. You have broken your chair, and made a great disturbance; that
      is an offense punishable by imprisonment in one of the lower dungeons.
      Promise me not to begin over again, and I will not say a word about it to
      the governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see the governor,&rdquo; replied the king, still governing his
      passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will send you off to one of the dungeons, I tell you; so take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon it, do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! your eyes are becoming wild again. Very good! I shall take away
      your knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the jailer did what he said, quitted the prisoner, and closed the
      door, leaving the king more astounded, more wretched, more isolated than
      ever. It was useless, though he tried it, to make the same noise again on
      his door, and equally useless that he threw the plates and dishes out of
      the window; not a single sound was heard in recognition. Two hours
      afterwards he could not be recognized as a king, a gentleman, a man, a
      human being; he might rather be called a madman, tearing the door with his
      nails, trying to tear up the flooring of his cell, and uttering such wild
      and fearful cries that the old Bastile seemed to tremble to its very
      foundations for having revolted against its master. As for the governor,
      the jailer did not even think of disturbing him; the turnkeys and the
      sentinels had reported the occurrence to him, but what was the good of it?
      Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison? and were not the
      walls still stronger? M. de Baisemeaux, thoroughly impressed with what
      Aramis had told him, and in perfect conformity with the king&rsquo;s order,
      hoped only that one thing might happen; namely, that the madman Marchiali
      might be mad enough to hang himself to the canopy of his bed, or to one of
      the bars of the window. In fact, the prisoner was anything but a
      profitable investment for M. Baisemeaux, and became more annoying than
      agreeable to him. These complications of Seldon and Marchiali&mdash;the
      complications first of setting at liberty and then imprisoning again, the
      complications arising from the strong likeness in question&mdash;had at
      last found a very proper <i>denouement</i>. Baisemeaux even thought he had
      remarked that D&rsquo;Herblay himself was not altogether dissatisfied with the
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, really,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux to his next in command, &ldquo;an ordinary
      prisoner is already unhappy enough in being a prisoner; he suffers quite
      enough, indeed, to induce one to hope, charitably enough, that his death
      may not be far distant. With still greater reason, accordingly, when the
      prisoner has gone mad, and might bite and make a terrible disturbance in
      the Bastile; why, in such a case, it is not simply an act of mere charity
      to wish him dead; it would be almost a good and even commendable action,
      quietly to have him put out of his misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the good-natured governor thereupon sat down to his late breakfast.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX. The Shadow of M. Fouquet.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, still confused and oppressed by the conversation he had just
      had with the king, could not resist asking himself if he were really in
      possession of his senses, if he were really and truly at Vaux; if he,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, were really the captain of the musketeers, and M. Fouquet the
      owner of the chateau in which Louis XIV. was at that moment partaking of
      his hospitality. These reflections were not those of a drunken man,
      although everything was in prodigal profusion at Vaux, and the
      surintendant&rsquo;s wines had met with a distinguished reception at the <i>fete</i>.
      The Gascon, however, was a man of calm self-possession; and no sooner did
      he touch his bright steel blade, than he knew how to adopt morally the
      cold, keen weapon as his guide of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, as he quitted the royal apartment, &ldquo;I seem now to be
      mixed up historically with the destinies of the king and of the minister;
      it will be written, that M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, a younger son of a Gascon family,
      placed his hand on the shoulder of M. Nicolas Fouquet, the surintendant of
      the finances of France. My descendants, if I have any, will flatter
      themselves with the distinction which this arrest will confer, just as the
      members of the De Luynes family have done with regard to the estates of
      the poor Marechal d&rsquo;Ancre. But the thing is, how best to execute the
      king&rsquo;s directions in a proper manner. Any man would know how to say to M.
      Fouquet, &lsquo;Your sword, monsieur.&rsquo; But it is not every one who would be able
      to take care of M. Fouquet without others knowing anything about it. How
      am I to manage, then, so that M. le surintendant pass from the height of
      favor to the direst disgrace; that Vaux be turned into a dungeon for him;
      that after having been steeped to his lips, as it were, in all the
      perfumes and incense of Ahasuerus, he is transferred to the gallows of
      Haman; in other words, of Enguerrand de Marigny?&rdquo; And at this reflection,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s brow became clouded with perplexity. The musketeer had
      certain scruples on the matter, it must be admitted. To deliver up to
      death (for not a doubt existed that Louis hated Fouquet mortally) the man
      who had just shown himself so delightful and charming a host in every way,
      was a real insult to one&rsquo;s conscience. &ldquo;It almost seems,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan
      to himself, &ldquo;that if I am not a poor, mean, miserable fellow, I should let
      M. Fouquet know the opinion the king has about him. Yet, if I betray my
      master&rsquo;s secret, I shall be a false-hearted, treacherous knave, a traitor,
      too, a crime provided for and punishable by military laws&mdash;so much
      so, indeed, that twenty times, in former days when wars were rife, I have
      seen many a miserable fellow strung up to a tree for doing, in but a small
      degree, what my scruples counsel me to undertake upon a great scale now.
      No, I think that a man of true readiness of wit ought to get out of this
      difficulty with more skill than that. And now, let us admit that I do
      possess a little readiness of invention; it is not at all certain, though,
      for, after having for forty years absorbed so large a quantity, I shall be
      lucky if there were to be a pistole&rsquo;s-worth left.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan buried his
      head in his hands, tore at his mustache in sheer vexation, and added,
      &ldquo;What can be the reason of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s disgrace? There seem to be three
      good ones: the first, because M. Colbert doesn&rsquo;t like him; the second,
      because he wished to fall in love with Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and
      lastly, because the king likes M. Colbert and loves Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere. Oh! he is lost! But shall I put my foot on his neck, I, of all
      men, when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and
      clerks? For shame! If he be dangerous, I will lay him low enough; if,
      however, he be only persecuted, I will look on. I have come to such a
      decisive determination, that neither king nor living man shall change my
      mind. If Athos were here, he would do as I have done. Therefore, instead
      of going, in cold blood, up to M. Fouquet, and arresting him off-hand and
      shutting him up altogether, I will try and conduct myself like a man who
      understands what good manners are. People will talk about it, of course;
      but they shall talk well of it, I am determined.&rdquo; And D&rsquo;Artagnan, drawing
      by a gesture peculiar to himself his shoulder-belt over his shoulder, went
      straight off to M. Fouquet, who, after he had taken leave of his guests,
      was preparing to retire for the night and to sleep tranquilly after the
      triumphs of the day. The air was still perfumed, or infected, whichever
      way it may be considered, with the odors of the torches and the fireworks.
      The wax-lights were dying away in their sockets, the flowers fell
      unfastened from the garlands, the groups of dancers and courtiers were
      separating in the salons. Surrounded by his friends, who complimented him
      and received his flattering remarks in return, the surintendant
      half-closed his wearied eyes. He longed for rest and quiet; he sank upon
      the bed of laurels which had been heaped up for him for so many days past;
      it might almost have been said that he seemed bowed beneath the weight of
      the new debts which he had incurred for the purpose of giving the greatest
      possible honor to this <i>fete</i>. Fouquet had just retired to his room,
      still smiling, but more than half-asleep. He could listen to nothing more,
      he could hardly keep his eyes open; his bed seemed to possess a
      fascinating and irresistible attraction for him. The god Morpheus, the
      presiding deity of the dome painted by Lebrun, had extended his influence
      over the adjoining rooms, and showered down his most sleep-inducing
      poppies upon the master of the house. Fouquet, almost entirely alone, was
      being assisted by his <i>valet de chambre</i> to undress, when M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan appeared at the entrance of the room. D&rsquo;Artagnan had never been
      able to succeed in making himself common at the court; and notwithstanding
      he was seen everywhere and on all occasions, he never failed to produce an
      effect wherever and whenever he made his appearance. Such is the happy
      privilege of certain natures, which in that respect resemble either
      thunder or lightning; every one recognizes them; but their appearance
      never fails to arouse surprise and astonishment, and whenever they occur,
      the impression is always left that the last was the most conspicuous or
      most important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! M. d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo; said Fouquet, who had already taken his right arm
      out of the sleeve of his doublet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service,&rdquo; replied the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, my dear M. d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come to criticise the <i>fete?</i> You are ingenious enough in
      your criticisms, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not your men looked after properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In every way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not comfortably lodged, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I have to thank you for being so amiably disposed, and I
      must not fail to express my obligations to you for all your flattering
      kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were as much as to say, &ldquo;My dear D&rsquo;Artagnan, pray go to bed,
      since you have a bed to lie down on, and let me do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan did not seem to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to bed already?&rdquo; he said to the superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; have you anything to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, monsieur, nothing at all. You sleep in this room, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; as you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given a most charming <i>fete</i> to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the king pleased?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enchanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he desire you to say as much to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not choose so unworthy a messenger, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not do yourself justice, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your bed, there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but why do you ask? Are you not satisfied with your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My I speak frankly to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet started; and then replied, &ldquo;Will you take my room, Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! deprive you of it, monseigneur? never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to share yours with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet looked at the musketeer fixedly. &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have just
      left the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king wishes you to pass the night in my room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, very well. You are the master here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, monseigneur, that I do not wish to abuse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet turned to his valet, and said, &ldquo;Leave us.&rdquo; When the man had left,
      he said to D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;You have something to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of your superior intelligence cannot have come to talk with a man
      like myself, at such an hour as the present, without grave motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not interrogate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary. What do you want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more than the pleasure of your society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the garden, then,&rdquo; said the superintendent suddenly, &ldquo;or into
      the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the musketeer, hastily, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fresh air&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, admit at once that you arrest me,&rdquo; said the superintendent to the
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend to look after me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur, I do, upon my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon your honor&mdash;ah! that is quite another thing! So I am to be
      arrested in my own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I will proclaim it aloud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do so, I shall be compelled to request you to be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! Violence towards me, and in my own house, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not seem to understand one another at all. Stay a moment; there is
      a chess-board there; we will have a game, if you have no objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, I am in disgrace, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prohibited, I suppose, from withdrawing from your sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand a word you are saying, monseigneur; and if you wish
      me to withdraw, tell me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, your mode of action is enough to drive me
      mad; I was almost sinking for want of sleep, but you have completely
      awakened me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forgive myself, I am sure; and if you wish to reconcile me
      with myself, why, go to sleep in your bed in my presence; and I shall be
      delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am under surveillance, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave the room if you say any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are beyond my comprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, monseigneur,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he pretended to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet ran after him. &ldquo;I will not lie down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Seriously, and
      since you refuse to treat me as a man, and since you finesse with me, I
      will try and set you at bay, as a hunter does a wild boar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, pretending to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall order my horses, and set off for Paris,&rdquo; said Fouquet, sounding
      the captain of the musketeers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be the case, monseigneur, it is very difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will arrest me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I shall go along with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite sufficient, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; returned Fouquet, coldly.
      &ldquo;It was not for nothing you acquired your reputation as a man of
      intelligence and resource; but with me all this is quite superfluous. Let
      us come to the point. Do me a service. Why do you arrest me? What have I
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know nothing about what you may have done; but I do not arrest you&mdash;this
      evening, at least!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening!&rdquo; said Fouquet, turning pale, &ldquo;but to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not to-morrow just yet, monseigneur. Who can ever answer for the
      morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick, captain! let me speak to M. d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! that is quite impossible, monseigneur. I have strict orders to see
      that you hold no communication with any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With M. d&rsquo;Herblay, captain&mdash;with your friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, is M. d&rsquo;Herblay the only person with whom you ought to be
      prevented holding any communication?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet colored, and then assuming an air of resignation, he said: &ldquo;You
      are right, monsieur; you have taught me a lesson I ought not to have
      evoked. A fallen man cannot assert his right to anything, even from those
      whose fortunes he may have made; for a still stronger reason, he cannot
      claim anything from those to whom he may never have had the happiness of
      doing a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly true, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan; you have always acted in the
      most admirable manner towards me&mdash;in such a manner, indeed, as most
      becomes the man who is destined to arrest me. You, at least, have never
      asked me anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the Gascon, touched by his eloquent and noble tone of
      grief, &ldquo;will you&mdash;I ask it as a favor&mdash;pledge me your word as a
      man of honor that you will not leave this room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of it, dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, since you keep watch and
      ward over me? Do you suppose I should contend against the most valiant
      sword in the kingdom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that, at all, monseigneur; but that I am going to look for M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay, and, consequently, to leave you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet uttered a cry of delight and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look for M. d&rsquo;Herblay! to leave me alone!&rdquo; he exclaimed, clasping his
      hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is M. d&rsquo;Herblay&rsquo;s room? The blue room is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend! thank you for that word, monseigneur; you confer it upon me
      to-day, at least, if you have never done so before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you have saved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room, and to
      return?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then to wake Aramis, who sleeps very soundly, when he is asleep, I
      put that down at another five minutes; making a total of fifteen minutes&rsquo;
      absence. And now, monseigneur, give me your word that you will not in any
      way attempt to make your escape, and that when I return I shall find you
      here again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Fouquet, with an expression of the warmest
      and deepest gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan disappeared. Fouquet looked at him as he quitted the room,
      waited with a feverish impatience until the door was closed behind him,
      and as soon as it was shut, flew to his keys, opened two or three secret
      doors concealed in various articles of furniture in the room, looked
      vainly for certain papers, which doubtless he had left at Saint-Mande, and
      which he seemed to regret not having found in them; then hurriedly seizing
      hold of letters, contracts, papers, writings, he heaped them up into a
      pile, which he burnt in the extremest haste upon the marble hearth of the
      fireplace, not even taking time to draw from the interior of it the vases
      and pots of flowers with which it was filled. As soon as he had finished,
      like a man who has just escaped an imminent danger, and whose strength
      abandons him as soon as the danger is past, he sank down, completely
      overcome, on a couch. When D&rsquo;Artagnan returned, he found Fouquet in the
      same position; the worthy musketeer had not the slightest doubt that
      Fouquet, having given his word, would not even think of failing to keep
      it, but he had thought it most likely that Fouquet would turn his
      (D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s) absence to the best advantage in getting rid of all the
      papers, memorandums, and contracts, which might possibly render his
      position, which was even now serious enough, more dangerous than ever. And
      so, lifting up his head like a dog who has regained the scent, he
      perceived an odor resembling smoke he had relied on finding in the
      atmosphere, and having found it, made a movement of his head in token of
      satisfaction. As D&rsquo;Artagnan entered, Fouquet, on his side, raised his
      head, and not one of D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s movements escaped him. And then the
      looks of the two men met, and they both saw that they had understood each
      other without exchanging a syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; asked Fouquet, the first to speak, &ldquo;and M. d&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay must be
      desperately fond of walking out at night, and composing verses by
      moonlight in the park of Vaux, with some of your poets, in all
      probability, for he is not in his own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! not in his own room?&rdquo; cried Fouquet, whose last hope thus escaped
      him; for unless he could ascertain in what way the bishop of Vannes could
      assist him, he perfectly well knew that he could expect assistance from no
      other quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, indeed,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;if he is in his own room, he has very
      good reasons for not answering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you did not call him in such a manner that he could have heard
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly suppose, monseigneur, that having already exceeded my
      orders, which forbade me leaving you a single moment&mdash;you can hardly
      suppose, I say, that I should have been mad enough to rouse the whole
      house and allow myself to be seen in the corridor of the bishop of Vannes,
      in order that M. Colbert might state with positive certainty that I gave
      you time to burn your papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; at least that is what I should have done in your place. When
      any one opens a door for me I always avail myself of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, and I thank you, for I have availed myself of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have done perfectly right. Every man has his own peculiar secrets
      with which others have nothing to do. But let us return to Aramis,
      monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I tell you, you could not have called loud enough, or Aramis
      would have heard you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However softly any one may call Aramis, monseigneur, Aramis always hears
      when he has an interest in hearing. I repeat what I said before&mdash;Aramis
      was not in his own room, or Aramis had certain reasons for not recognizing
      my voice, of which I am ignorant, and of which you may be even ignorant
      yourself, notwithstanding your liege-man is His Greatness the Lord Bishop
      of Vannes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet drew a deep sigh, rose from his seat, took three or four turns in
      his room, and finished by seating himself, with an expression of extreme
      dejection, upon his magnificent bed with velvet hangings, and costliest
      lace. D&rsquo;Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings of the deepest and
      sincerest pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen a good many men arrested in my life,&rdquo; said the musketeer,
      sadly; &ldquo;I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested,
      though I was very young then. I have seen M. de Conde arrested with the
      princes; I have seen M. de Retz arrested; I have seen M. Broussel
      arrested. Stay a moment, monseigneur, it is disagreeable to have to say,
      but the very one of all those whom you most resemble at this moment was
      that poor fellow Broussel. You were very near doing as he did, putting
      your dinner napkin in your portfolio, and wiping your mouth with your
      papers. <i>Mordioux!</i> Monseigneur Fouquet, a man like you ought not to
      be dejected in this manner. Suppose your friends saw you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; returned the surintendant, with a smile full of
      gentleness, &ldquo;you do not understand me; it is precisely because my friends
      are not looking on, that I am as you see me now. I do not live, exist
      even, isolated from others; I am nothing when left to myself. Understand
      that throughout my whole life I have passed every moment of my time in
      making friends, whom I hoped to render my stay and support. In times of
      prosperity, all these cheerful, happy voices&mdash;rendered so through and
      by my means&mdash;formed in my honor a concert of praise and kindly
      actions. In the least disfavor, these humbler voices accompanied in
      harmonious accents the murmur of my own heart. Isolation I have never yet
      known. Poverty (a phantom I have sometimes beheld, clad in rags, awaiting
      me at the end of my journey through life)&mdash;poverty has been the
      specter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past,
      which they poetize and caress, and which has attracted me towards them.
      Poverty! I accept it, acknowledge it, receive it, as a disinherited
      sister; for poverty is neither solitude, nor exile, nor imprisonment. Is
      it likely I shall ever be poor, with such friends as Pelisson, as La
      Fontaine, as Moliere? with such a mistress as&mdash;Oh! if you knew how
      utterly lonely and desolate I feel at this moment, and how you, who
      separate me from all I love, seem to resemble the image of solitude, of
      annihilation&mdash;death itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have already told you, Monsieur Fouquet,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, moved
      to the depths of his soul, &ldquo;that you are woefully exaggerating. The king
      likes you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Fouquet, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Colbert hates you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Colbert! What does that matter to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will ruin you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I defy him to do that, for I am ruined already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this singular confession of the superintendent, D&rsquo;Artagnan cast his
      glance all round the room; and although he did not open his lips, Fouquet
      understood him so thoroughly, that he added: &ldquo;What can be done with such
      wealth of substance as surrounds us, when a man can no longer cultivate
      his taste for the magnificent? Do you know what good the greater part of
      the wealth and the possessions which we rich enjoy, confer upon us? merely
      to disgust us, by their very splendor even, with everything which does not
      equal it! Vaux! you will say, and the wonders of Vaux! What of it? What
      boot these wonders? If I am ruined, how shall I fill with water the urns
      which my Naiads bear in their arms, or force the air into the lungs of my
      Tritons? To be rich enough, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, a man must be too rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know very well what you think,&rdquo; replied Fouquet, quickly. &ldquo;If Vaux
      were yours, you would sell it, and would purchase an estate in the
      country; an estate which should have woods, orchards, and land attached,
      so that the estate should be made to support its master. With forty
      millions you might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten millions,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a million, my dear captain. No one in France is rich enough to give
      two millions for Vaux, and to continue to maintain it as I have done; no
      one could do it, no one would know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;in any case, a million is not abject misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not far from it, my dear monsieur. But you do not understand me.
      No; I will not sell my residence at Vaux; I will give it to you, if you
      like;&rdquo; and Fouquet accompanied these words with a movement of the
      shoulders to which it would be impossible to do justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to the king; you will make a better bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king does not require me to give it to him,&rdquo; said Fouquet; &ldquo;he will
      take it away from me with the most absolute ease and grace, if it pleases
      him to do so; and that is the very reason I should prefer to see it
      perish. Do you know, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, that if the king did not happen
      to be under my roof, I would take this candle, go straight to the dome,
      and set fire to a couple of huge chests of fusees and fireworks which are
      in reserve there, and would reduce my palace to ashes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the musketeer, negligently. &ldquo;At all events, you would not be
      able to burn the gardens, and that is the finest feature of the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; resumed Fouquet, thoughtfully, &ldquo;what was I saying? Great
      heavens! burn Vaux! destroy my palace! But Vaux is not mine; these
      wonderful creations are, it is true, the property, as far as sense of
      enjoyment goes, of the man who has paid for them; but as far as duration
      is concerned, they belong to those who created them. Vaux belongs to
      Lebrun, to Lenotre, to Pelisson, to Levau, to La Fontaine, to Moliere;
      Vaux belongs to posterity, in fact. You see, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, that my
      very house has ceased to be my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all well and good,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;the idea is agreeable
      enough, and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it. That idea, indeed, makes
      me forget that poor fellow Broussel altogether; and I now fail to
      recognize in you the whining complaints of that old Frondeur. If you are
      ruined, monsieur, look at the affair manfully, for you too, <i>mordioux!</i>
      belong to posterity, and have no right to lessen yourself in any way. Stay
      a moment; look at me, I who seem to exercise in some degree a kind of
      superiority over you, because I am arresting you; fate, which distributes
      their different parts to the comedians of this world, accorded me a less
      agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than yours has been. I am one
      of those who think that the parts which kings and powerful nobles are
      called upon to act are infinitely of more worth than the parts of beggars
      or lackeys. It is far better on the stage&mdash;on the stage, I mean, of
      another theater than the theater of this world&mdash;it is far better to
      wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language, than to walk the boards shod
      with a pair of old shoes, or to get one&rsquo;s backbone gently polished by a
      hearty dressing with a stick. In one word, you have been a prodigal with
      money, you have ordered and been obeyed&mdash;have been steeped to the
      lips in enjoyment; while I have dragged my tether after me, have been
      commanded and have obeyed, and have drudged my life away. Well, although I
      may seem of such trifling importance beside you, monseigneur, I do declare
      to you, that the recollection of what I have done serves me as a spur, and
      prevents me from bowing my old head too soon. I shall remain unto the very
      end a trooper; and when my turn comes, I shall fall perfectly straight,
      all in a heap, still alive, after having selected my place beforehand. Do
      as I do, Monsieur Fouquet, you will not find yourself the worse for it; a
      fall happens only once in a lifetime to men like yourself, and the chief
      thing is, to take it gracefully when the chance presents itself. There is
      a Latin proverb&mdash;the words have escaped me, but I remember the sense
      of it very well, for I have thought over it more than once&mdash;which
      says, &lsquo;The end crowns the work!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet rose from his seat, passed his arm round D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s neck, and
      clasped him in a close embrace, whilst with the other hand he pressed his
      hand. &ldquo;An excellent homily,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier&rsquo;s, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a regard for me, in telling me all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more, and then, a moment after,
      he said: &ldquo;Where can M. d&rsquo;Herblay be? I dare not ask you to send for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not ask me, because I would not do it, Monsieur Fouquet. People
      would learn it, and Aramis, who is not mixed up with the affair, might
      possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait here till daylight,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do when daylight comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing at all about it, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, will you do me a favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You guard me, I remain; you are acting in the full discharge of your
      duty, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like; and I
      infinitely prefer such a shadow to any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan bowed to the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, forget that you are Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, captain of the musketeers;
      forget that I am Monsieur Fouquet, surintendant of the finances; and let
      us talk about my affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather a delicate subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but, for your sake, Monsieur Fouquet, I will do what may almost be
      regarded as an impossibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. What did the king say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is that the way you talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of my situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, unless you have some ill feeling against me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your position is a difficult one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what respect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are under your own roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However difficult it may be, I understand it very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that, with any one else but yourself, I should have shown
      so much frankness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! so much frankness, do you say? you, who refuse to tell me the
      slightest thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, then, so much ceremony and consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I have nothing to say in that respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, monseigneur: let me tell you how I should have behaved
      towards any one but yourself. It might be that I happened to arrive at
      your door just as your guests or your friends had left you&mdash;or, if
      they had not gone yet, I should wait until they were leaving, and should
      then catch them one after the other, like rabbits; I should lock them up
      quietly enough, I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor,
      and with one hand upon you, before you suspected the slightest thing
      amiss, I should keep you safely until my master&rsquo;s breakfast in the
      morning. In this way, I should just the same have avoided all publicity,
      all disturbance, all opposition; but there would also have been no warning
      for M. Fouquet, no consideration for his feelings, none of those delicate
      concessions which are shown by persons who are essentially courteous in
      their natures, whenever the decisive moment may arrive. Are you satisfied
      with the plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me shudder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would not like it. It would have been very disagreeable to
      have made my appearance to-morrow, without any preparation, and to have
      asked you to deliver up your sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur, I should have died of shame and anger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gratitude is too eloquently expressed. I have not done enough to
      deserve it, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly, monsieur, you will never get me to believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, monseigneur, if you are satisfied with what I have done, and
      have somewhat recovered from the shock which I prepared you for as much as
      I possibly could, let us allow the few hours that remain to pass away
      undisturbed. You are harassed, and should arrange your thoughts; I beg
      you, therefore, go to sleep, or pretend to go to sleep, either on your
      bed, or in your bed; I will sleep in this armchair; and when I fall
      asleep, my rest is so sound that a cannon would not wake me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet smiled. &ldquo;I expect, however,&rdquo; continued the musketeer, &ldquo;the case of
      a door being opened, whether a secret door, or any other; or the case of
      any one going out of, or coming into, the room&mdash;for anything like
      that my ear is as quick and sensitive as the ear of a mouse. Creaking
      noises make me start. It arises, I suppose, from a natural antipathy to
      anything of the kind. Move about as much as you like; walk up and down in
      any part of the room, write, efface, destroy, burn,&mdash;nothing like
      that will prevent me from going to sleep or even prevent me from snoring,
      but do not touch either the key or the handle of the door, for I should
      start up in a moment, and that would shake my nerves and make me ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;you are certainly the most witty and
      the most courteous man I ever met with; and you will leave me only one
      regret, that of having made your acquaintance so late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan drew a deep sigh, which seemed to say, &ldquo;Alas! you have perhaps
      made it too soon.&rdquo; He then settled himself in his armchair, while Fouquet,
      half lying on his bed and leaning on his arm, was meditating on his
      misadventures. In this way, both of them, leaving the candles burning,
      awaited the first dawn of the day; and when Fouquet happened to sigh too
      loudly, D&rsquo;Artagnan only snored the louder. Not a single visit, not even
      from Aramis, disturbed their quietude: not a sound even was heard
      throughout the whole vast palace. Outside, however, the guards of honor on
      duty, and the patrol of musketeers, paced up and down; and the sound of
      their feet could be heard on the gravel walks. It seemed to act as an
      additional soporific for the sleepers, while the murmuring of the wind
      through the trees, and the unceasing music of the fountains whose waters
      tumbled in the basin, still went on uninterruptedly, without being
      disturbed at the slight noises and items of little moment that constitute
      the life and death of human nature.

    <h2>
      Chapter XX. The Morning.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In vivid contrast to the sad and terrible destiny of the king imprisoned
      in the Bastile, and tearing, in sheer despair, the bolts and bars of his
      dungeon, the rhetoric of the chroniclers of old would not fail to present,
      as a complete antithesis, the picture of Philippe lying asleep beneath the
      royal canopy. We do not pretend to say that such rhetoric is always bad,
      and always scatters, in places where they have no right to grow, the
      flowers with which it embellishes and enlivens history. But we shall, on
      the present occasion, carefully avoid polishing the antithesis in
      question, but shall proceed to draw another picture as minutely as
      possible, to serve as foil and counterfoil to the one in the preceding
      chapter. The young prince alighted from Aramis&rsquo;s room, in the same way the
      king had descended from the apartment dedicated to Morpheus. The dome
      gradually and slowly sank down under Aramis&rsquo;s pressure, and Philippe stood
      beside the royal bed, which had ascended again after having deposited its
      prisoner in the secret depths of the subterranean passage. Alone, in the
      presence of all the luxury which surrounded him; alone, in the presence of
      his power; alone, with the part he was about to be forced to act, Philippe
      for the first time felt his heart, and mind, and soul expand beneath the
      influence of a thousand mutable emotions, which are the vital throbs of a
      king&rsquo;s heart. He could not help changing color when he looked upon the
      empty bed, still tumbled by his brother&rsquo;s body. This mute accomplice had
      returned, after having completed the work it had been destined to perform;
      it returned with the traces of the crime; it spoke to the guilty author of
      that crime, with the frank and unreserved language which an accomplice
      never fears to use in the company of his companion in guilt; for it spoke
      the truth. Philippe bent over the bed, and perceived a pocket-handkerchief
      lying on it, which was still damp from the cold sweat which had poured
      from Louis XIV.&lsquo;s face. This sweat-bestained handkerchief terrified
      Philippe, as the gore of Abel frightened Cain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am face to face with my destiny,&rdquo; said Philippe, his eyes on fire, and
      his face a livid white. &ldquo;Is it likely to be more terrifying than my
      captivity has been sad and gloomy? Though I am compelled to follow out, at
      every moment, the sovereign power and authority I have usurped, shall I
      cease to listen to the scruples of my heart? Yes! the king has lain on
      this bed; it is indeed his head that has left its impression on this
      pillow; his bitter tears that have stained this handkerchief: and yet, I
      hesitate to throw myself on the bed, or to press in my hand the
      handkerchief which is embroidered with my brother&rsquo;s arms. Away with such
      weakness; let me imitate M. d&rsquo;Herblay, who asserts that a man&rsquo;s action
      should be always one degree above his thoughts; let me imitate M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay, whose thoughts are of and for himself alone, who regards
      himself as a man of honor, so long as he injures or betrays his enemies
      only. I, I alone, should have occupied this bed, if Louis XIV. had not,
      owing to my mother&rsquo;s criminal abandonment, stood in my way; and this
      handkerchief, embroidered with the arms of France, would in right and
      justice belong to me alone, if, as M. d&rsquo;Herblay observes, I had been left
      my royal cradle. Philippe, son of France, take your place on that bed;
      Philippe, sole king of France, resume the blazonry that is yours!
      Philippe, sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII., your father, show yourself
      without pity or mercy for the usurper who, at this moment, has not even to
      suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to submit to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Philippe, notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of
      feeling, and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will,
      threw himself on the royal bed, and forced his muscles to press the still
      warm place where Louis XIV. had lain, while he buried his burning face in
      the handkerchief still moistened by his brother&rsquo;s tears. With his head
      thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow, Philippe perceived
      above him the crown of France, suspended, as we have stated, by angels
      with outspread golden wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man may be ambitious of lying in a lion&rsquo;s den, but can hardly hope to
      sleep there quietly. Philippe listened attentively to every sound; his
      heart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching terror and
      misfortune; but confident in his own strength, which was confirmed by the
      force of an overpoweringly resolute determination, he waited until some
      decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself. He hoped
      that imminent danger might be revealed to him, like those phosphoric
      lights of the tempest which show the sailors the altitude of the waves
      against which they have to struggle. But nothing approached. Silence, that
      mortal enemy of restless hearts, and of ambitious minds, shrouded in the
      thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night the future king
      of France, who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen crown. Towards the
      morning a shadow, rather than a body, glided into the royal chamber;
      Philippe expected his approach and neither expressed nor exhibited any
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M. d&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire, all is accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly as we expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he resist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terribly! tears and entreaties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perfect stupor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! at last, a complete victory, and absolute silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the governor of the Bastile suspect anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The resemblance, however&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the cause of the success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the prisoner cannot fail to explain himself. Think well of that. I
      have myself been able to do as much as that, on former occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already provided for every chance. In a few days, sooner if
      necessary, we will take the captive out of his prison, and will send him
      out of the country, to a place of exile so remote&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People can return from their exile, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a place of exile so distant, I was going to say, that human strength
      and the duration of human life would not be enough for his return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more a cold look of intelligence passed between Aramis and the young
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. du Vallon?&rdquo; asked Philippe in order to change the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be presented to you to-day, and confidentially will congratulate
      you on the danger which that conspirator has made you run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With M. du Vallon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; confer a dukedom on him, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dukedom,&rdquo; replied Aramis, smiling in a significant manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laugh at the extreme caution of your idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cautious, why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is doubtless afraid that poor Porthos may possible become a
      troublesome witness, and you wish to get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! in making him a duke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; you would assuredly kill him, for he would die from joy, and
      the secret would die with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aramis, phlegmatically; &ldquo;I should lose a very good friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, and in the middle of this idle conversation, under the
      light tone of which the two conspirators concealed their joy and pride at
      their mutual success, Aramis heard something which made him prick up his
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dawn, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, before you retired to bed last night, you probably decided to do
      something this morning at break of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I told my captain of the musketeers,&rdquo; replied the young man
      hurriedly, &ldquo;that I should expect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you told him that, he will certainly be here, for he is a most
      punctual man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear a step in the vestibule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us begin the attack,&rdquo; said the young king resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be cautious for Heaven&rsquo;s sake. To begin the attack, and with D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      would be madness. D&rsquo;Artagnan knows nothing, he has seen nothing; he is a
      hundred miles from suspecting our mystery in the slightest degree, but if
      he comes into this room the first this morning, he will be sure to detect
      something of what has taken place, and which he would imagine it his
      business to occupy himself about. Before we allow D&rsquo;Artagnan to penetrate
      into this room, we must air the room thoroughly, or introduce so many
      people into it, that the keenest scent in the whole kingdom may be
      deceived by the traces of twenty different persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?&rdquo;
       observed the prince, impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an
      antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care of that,&rdquo; replied the bishop, &ldquo;and in order to begin, I
      am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, too, is striking a blow, for I hear him at the door,&rdquo; added the
      prince, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, a knock at the door was heard at that moment. Aramis was not
      mistaken; for it was indeed D&rsquo;Artagnan who adopted that mode of announcing
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet,
      but the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep, and as
      soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the
      sumptuous cornices of the superintendent&rsquo;s room, D&rsquo;Artagnan rose from his
      armchair, arranged his sword, brushed his coat and hat with his sleeve,
      like a private soldier getting ready for inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going out?&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur. And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pledge your word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Besides, my only reason for going out is to try and get that
      reply,&mdash;you know what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sentence, you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, I have something of the old Roman in me. This morning, when I got
      up, I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the <i>aiguillettes</i>,
      and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off. That is an infallible
      sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of prosperity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, be sure of it; for every time that that confounded belt of mine
      stuck fast to my back, it always signified a punishment from M. de
      Treville, or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin. Every time my sword hung
      fast to my shoulder-belt, it always predicted some disagreeable commission
      or another for me to execute, and I have had showers of them all my life
      through. Every time, too, my sword danced about in its sheath, a duel,
      fortunate in its result, was sure to follow: whenever it dangled about the
      calves of my legs, it signified a slight wound; every time it fell
      completely out of the scabbard, I was booked, and made up my mind that I
      should have to remain on the field of battle, with two or three months
      under surgical bandages into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know your sword kept you so well informed,&rdquo; said Fouquet, with
      a faint smile, which showed how he was struggling against his own
      weakness. &ldquo;Is your sword bewitched, or under the influence of some
      imperial charm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my own
      body. I have heard that certain men seem to have warnings given them by
      feeling something the matter with their legs, or a throbbing of their
      temples. With me, it is my sword that warns me. Well, it told me of
      nothing this morning. But, stay a moment&mdash;look here, it has just
      fallen of its own accord into the last hole of the belt. Do you know what
      that is a warning of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that tells me of an arrest that will have to be made this very
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the surintendant, more astonished than annoyed by this
      frankness, &ldquo;if there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your
      sword, I am to conclude that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! arrest <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. The warning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not concern you, since you have been arrested ever since yesterday.
      It is not you I shall have to arrest, be assured of that. That is the
      reason why I am delighted, and also the reason why I said that my day will
      be a happy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words, pronounced with the most affectionate graciousness
      of manner, the captain took leave of Fouquet in order to wait upon the
      king. He was on the point of leaving the room, when Fouquet said to him,
      &ldquo;One last mark of kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay; let me see Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to try and get him to come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan did not think himself so good a prophet. It was written that
      the day would pass away and realize all the predictions that had been made
      in the morning. He had accordingly knocked, as we have seen, at the king&rsquo;s
      door. The door opened. The captain thought that it was the king who had
      just opened it himself; and this supposition was not altogether
      inadmissible, considering the state of agitation in which he had left
      Louis XIV. the previous evening; but instead of his royal master, whom he
      was on the point of saluting with the greatest respect, he perceived the
      long, calm features of Aramis. So extreme was his surprise that he could
      hardly refrain from uttering a loud exclamation. &ldquo;Aramis!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, dear D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; replied the prelate, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here!&rdquo; stammered out the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His majesty desires you to report that he is still sleeping, after having
      been greatly fatigued during the whole night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, who could not understand how the bishop of Vannes,
      who had been so indifferent a favorite the previous evening, had become in
      half a dozen hours the most magnificent mushroom of fortune that had ever
      sprung up in a sovereign&rsquo;s bedroom. In fact, to transmit the orders of the
      king even to the mere threshold of that monarch&rsquo;s room, to serve as an
      intermediary of Louis XIV. so as to be able to give a single order in his
      name at a couple paces from him, he must have become more than Richelieu
      had ever been to Louis XIII. D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s expressive eye, half-opened
      lips, his curling mustache, said as much indeed in the plainest language
      to the chief favorite, who remained calm and perfectly unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; continued the bishop, &ldquo;you will be good enough, monsieur le
      capitaine des mousquetaires, to allow those only to pass into the king&rsquo;s
      room this morning who have special permission. His majesty does not wish
      to be disturbed just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected D&rsquo;Artagnan, almost on the point of refusing to obey this
      order, and particularly of giving unrestrained passage to the suspicions
      which the king&rsquo;s silence had aroused&mdash;&ldquo;but, monsieur l&rsquo;eveque, his
      majesty gave me a rendezvous for this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later, later,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s voice, from the bottom of the alcove; a
      voice which made a cold shudder pass through the musketeer&rsquo;s veins. He
      bowed, amazed, confused, and stupefied by the smile with which Aramis
      seemed to overwhelm him, as soon as these words had been pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued the bishop, &ldquo;as an answer to what you were coming to
      ask the king, my dear D&rsquo;Artagnan, here is an order of his majesty, which
      you will be good enough to attend to forthwith, for it concerns M.
      Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan took the order which was held out to him. &ldquo;To be set at
      liberty!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and he uttered a second &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; still more full
      of intelligence than the former; for this order explained Aramis&rsquo;s
      presence with the king, and that Aramis, in order to have obtained
      Fouquet&rsquo;s pardon, must have made considerable progress in the royal favor,
      and that this favor explained, in its tenor, the hardly conceivable
      assurance with which M. d&rsquo;Herblay issued the order in the king&rsquo;s name. For
      D&rsquo;Artagnan it was quite sufficient to have understood something of the
      matter in hand to order to understand the rest. He bowed and withdrew a
      couple of paces, as though he were about to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with you,&rdquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To M. Fouquet; I wish to be a witness of his delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Aramis, how you puzzled me just now!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you understand <i>now</i>, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I understand,&rdquo; he said aloud; but added in a low tone to
      himself, almost hissing the words between his teeth, &ldquo;No, no, I do not
      understand yet. But it is all the same, for here is the order for it.&rdquo; And
      then he added, &ldquo;I will lead the way, monseigneur,&rdquo; and he conducted Aramis
      to Fouquet&rsquo;s apartments.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXI. The King&rsquo;s Friend.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fouquet was waiting with anxiety; he had already sent away many of his
      servants and friends, who, anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary
      receptions, had called at his door to inquire after him. Preserving the
      utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair above
      his head, he only asked them, as he did every one, indeed, who came to the
      door, where Aramis was. When he saw D&rsquo;Artagnan return, and when he
      perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him, he could hardly restrain his
      delight; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness. The mere sight of
      Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for the unhappiness
      he had undergone in his arrest. The prelate was silent and grave;
      D&rsquo;Artagnan completely bewildered by such an accumulation of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain, so you have brought M. d&rsquo;Herblay to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And something better still, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; by the king&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet resumed his usual serenity, that he might interrogate Aramis with
      a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, you can thank M. l&rsquo;eveque de Vannes,&rdquo; pursued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;for
      it is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Fouquet, more humiliated at the service than grateful at its
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, addressing Aramis&mdash;&ldquo;you, who have
      become M. Fouquet&rsquo;s protector and patron, can you not do something for
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything in the wide world you like, my friend,&rdquo; replied the bishop, in
      his calmest tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing only, then, and I shall be perfectly satisfied. How on earth
      did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never
      spoken to him more than twice in your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a friend such as you are,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;I cannot conceal anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! very good, tell me, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You think that I have seen the king only twice, whilst the
      fact is I have seen him more than a hundred times; only we have kept it
      very secret, that is all.&rdquo; And without trying to remove the color which at
      this revelation made D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s face flush scarlet, Aramis turned
      towards M. Fouquet, who was as much surprised as the musketeer.
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;the king desires me to inform you that he is
      more than ever your friend, and that your beautiful <i>fete</i>, so
      generously offered by you on his behalf, has touched him to the very
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner, that
      the latter, incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was of so
      prodigious a character, remained incapable of uttering a single syllable,
      and equally incapable of thought or movement. D&rsquo;Artagnan fancied he
      perceived that these two men had something to say to each other, and he
      was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive politeness which in such
      a case hurries a man towards the door, when he feels his presence is an
      inconvenience for others; but his eager curiosity, spurred on by so many
      mysteries, counseled him to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis thereupon turned towards him, and said, in a quiet tone, &ldquo;You will
      not forget, my friend, the king&rsquo;s order respecting those whom he intends
      to receive this morning on rising.&rdquo; These words were clear enough, and the
      musketeer understood them; he therefore bowed to Fouquet, and then to
      Aramis,&mdash;to the latter with a slight admixture of ironical respect,&mdash;and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he left, than Fouquet, whose impatience had hardly been able
      to wait for that moment, darted towards the door to close it, and then
      returning to the bishop, he said, &ldquo;My dear D&rsquo;Herblay, I think it now high
      time you should explain all that has passed, for, in plain and honest
      truth, I do not understand anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will explain all that to you,&rdquo; said Aramis, sitting down, and making
      Fouquet sit down also. &ldquo;Where shall I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this first of all. Why does the king set me at liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since my arrest, I have had time to think over it, and my idea is that it
      arises out of some slight feeling of jealousy. My <i>fete</i> put M.
      Colbert out of temper, and M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint
      against me; Belle-Isle, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; there is no question at all just now of Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember those receipts for thirteen millions which M. de Mazarin
      contrived to steal from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are pronounced a public robber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is not all. Do you also remember that letter you wrote to La
      Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that proclaims you a traitor and a suborner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he have pardoned me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not yet arrived at that part of our argument. I wish you to be
      quite convinced of the fact itself. Observe this well: the king knows you
      to be guilty of an appropriation of public funds. Oh! of course <i>I</i>
      know that you have done nothing of the kind; but, at all events, the king
      has seen the receipts, and he can do no other than believe you are
      incriminated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I do not see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see presently, though. The king, moreover, having read your
      love-letter to La Valliere, and the offers you there made her, cannot
      retain any doubt of your intentions with regard to that young lady; you
      will admit that, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Pray conclude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the fewest words. The king, we may henceforth assume, is your
      powerful, implacable, and eternal enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed. But am I, then, so powerful, that he has not dared to sacrifice
      me, notwithstanding his hatred, with all the means which my weakness, or
      my misfortunes, may have given him as a hold upon me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear, beyond all doubt,&rdquo; pursued Aramis, coldly, &ldquo;that the king
      has quarreled with you&mdash;irreconcilably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, since he has absolved me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe it likely?&rdquo; asked the bishop, with a searching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without believing in his sincerity, I believe it in the accomplished
      fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis slightly shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, then, should Louis XIV. have commissioned you to tell me what
      you have just stated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king charged me with no message for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With nothing!&rdquo; said the superintendent, stupefied. &ldquo;But, that order&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. You are quite right. There <i>is</i> an order, certainly;&rdquo; and
      these words were pronounced by Aramis in so strange a tone, that Fouquet
      could not resist starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are concealing something from me, I see. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis softly rubbed his white fingers over his chin, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the king exile me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not act as if you were playing at the game children play at when they
      have to try and guess where a thing has been hidden, and are informed, by
      a bell being rung, when they are approaching near to it, or going away
      from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alarm me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! that is because you have not guessed, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the king say to you? In the name of our friendship, do not
      deceive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has not said one word to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are killing me with impatience, D&rsquo;Herblay. Am I still
      superintendent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what extraordinary empire have you so suddenly acquired over his
      majesty&rsquo;s mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does your bidding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hardly credible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So any one would say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Herblay, by our alliance, by our friendship, by everything you hold
      dearest in the world, speak openly, I implore you. By what means have you
      succeeded in overcoming Louis XIV.&lsquo;s prejudices, for he did not like you,
      I am certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will like me <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said Aramis, laying stress upon the
      last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something particular, then, between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty&rsquo;s interests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, indeed, a man of superior intelligence, monseigneur, and have
      made a particularly accurate guess. I have, in fact, discovered a secret,
      of a nature to change the interests of the king of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Fouquet, with the reserve of a man who does not wish to ask any
      more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you shall judge of it yourself,&rdquo; pursued Aramis; &ldquo;and you shall tell
      me if I am mistaken with regard to the importance of this secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening, since you are good enough to unbosom yourself to me; only
      do not forget that I have asked you about nothing which it may be
      indiscreet in you to communicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis seemed, for a moment, as if he were collecting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak!&rdquo; said Fouquet: &ldquo;there is still time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; said the bishop, casting down his eyes, &ldquo;the birth of
      Louis XIV.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if it were yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; except that the king was not really the son of Louis XIII.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not matter to us, or the kingdom either; he is the son of his
      father, says the French law, whose father is recognized by law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but it is a grave matter, when the quality of races is called into
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A merely secondary question, after all. So that, in fact, you have never
      learned or heard anything in particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where my secret begins. The queen, you must know, instead of
      being delivered of a son, was delivered of twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet looked up suddenly as he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the second is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see. These twins seemed likely to be regarded as the pride of
      their mother, and the hope of France; but the weak nature of the king, his
      superstitious feelings, made him apprehend a series of conflicts between
      two children whose rights were equal; so he put out of the way&mdash;he
      suppressed&mdash;one of the twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppressed, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience. Both the children grew up; the one on the throne, whose
      minister you are&mdash;the other, who is my friend, in gloom and
      isolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! What are you saying, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay? And what is this
      poor prince doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me, rather, what has he done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was brought up in the country, and then thrown into a fortress which
      goes by the name of the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; cried the surintendant, clasping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one was the most fortunate of men: the other the most unhappy and
      miserable of all living beings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does his mother not know this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne of Austria knows it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark seemed to make a great impression on Aramis; he looked at
      Fouquet with the most anxious expression of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; I interrupted you,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying,&rdquo; resumed Aramis, &ldquo;that this poor prince was the unhappiest
      of human beings, when Heaven, whose thoughts are over all His creatures,
      undertook to come to his assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! in what way? Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see. The reigning king&mdash;I say the reigning king&mdash;you
      can guess very well why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because <i>both</i> of them, being legitimate princes, ought to have been
      kings. Is not that your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unreservedly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most unreservedly; twins are one person in two bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased that a legist of your learning and authority should have
      pronounced such an opinion. It is agreed, then, that each of them
      possessed equal rights, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incontestably! but, gracious heavens, what an extraordinary
      circumstance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not at the end of it yet.&mdash;Patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall find &lsquo;patience&rsquo; enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven wished to raise up for that oppressed child an avenger, or a
      supporter, or vindicator, if you prefer it. It happened that the reigning
      king, the usurper&mdash;you are quite of my opinion, I believe, that it is
      an act of usurpation quietly to enjoy, and selfishly to assume the right
      over, an inheritance to which a man has only half a right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, usurpation is the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I continue. It was Heaven&rsquo;s will that the usurper should
      possess, in the person of his first minister, a man of great talent, of
      large and generous nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;I understand you; you have relied upon me to
      repair the wrong which has been done to this unhappy brother of Louis XIV.
      You have thought well; I will help you. I thank you, D&rsquo;Herblay, I thank
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it is not that at all; you have not allowed me to finish,&rdquo; said
      Aramis, perfectly unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not say another word, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet, I was observing, the minister of the reigning sovereign, was
      suddenly taken into the greatest aversion, and menaced with the ruin of
      his fortune, loss of liberty, loss of life even, by intrigue and personal
      hatred, to which the king gave too readily an attentive ear. But Heaven
      permits (still, however, out of consideration for the unhappy prince who
      had been sacrificed) that M. Fouquet should in his turn have a devoted
      friend who knew this state secret, and felt that he possessed strength and
      courage enough to divulge this secret, after having had the strength to
      carry it locked up in his own heart for twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go no farther,&rdquo; said Fouquet, full of generous feelings. &ldquo;I understand
      you, and can guess everything now. You went to see the king when the
      intelligence of my arrest reached you; you implored him, he refused to
      listen to you; then you threatened him with that secret, threatened to
      reveal it, and Louis XIV., alarmed at the risk of its betrayal, granted to
      the terror of your indiscretion what he refused to your generous
      intercession. I understand, I understand; you have the king in your power;
      I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand <i>nothing</i>&mdash;as yet,&rdquo; replied Aramis, &ldquo;and again
      you interrupt me. Then, too, allow me to observe that you pay no attention
      to logical reasoning, and seem to forget what you ought most to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know upon what I laid the greatest stress at the beginning of our
      conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his majesty&rsquo;s hate, invincible hate for me; yes, but what feeling of
      hate could resist the threat of such a revelation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a revelation, do you say? that is the very point where your logic
      fails you. What! do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to
      the king, I should have been alive now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not ten minutes ago that you were with the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be. He might not have had the time to get me killed outright,
      but he would have had the time to get me gagged and thrown in a dungeon.
      Come, come, show a little consistency in your reasoning, <i>mordieu!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And by the mere use of this word, which was so thoroughly his old
      musketeer&rsquo;s expression, forgotten by one who never seemed to forget
      anything, Fouquet could not but understand to what a pitch of exaltation
      the calm, impenetrable bishop of Vannes had wrought himself. He shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; replied the latter, after having mastered his feelings,
      &ldquo;should I be the man I really am, should I be the true friend you believe
      me, if I were to expose you, whom the king already hates so bitterly, to a
      feeling more than ever to be dreaded in that young man? To have robbed
      him, is nothing; to have addressed the woman he loves, is not much; but to
      hold in your keeping both his crown and his honor, why, he would pluck out
      your heart with his own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would sooner, far sooner, have swallowed at one draught all the poisons
      that Mithridates drank in twenty years, in order to try and avoid death,
      than have betrayed my secret to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now we are coming to the point, monseigneur. I think I shall not fail
      to excite in you a little interest. You are listening, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you ask me if I am listening? Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis walked softly all round the room, satisfied himself that they were
      alone, and that all was silent, and then returned and placed himself close
      to the armchair in which Fouquet was seated, awaiting with the deepest
      anxiety the revelation he had to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot to tell you,&rdquo; resumed Aramis, addressing himself to Fouquet, who
      listened to him with the most absorbed attention&mdash;&ldquo;I forgot to
      mention a most remarkable circumstance respecting these twins, namely,
      that God had formed them so startlingly, so miraculously, like each other,
      that it would be utterly impossible to distinguish the one from the other.
      Their own mother would not be able to distinguish them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same noble character in their features, the same carriage, the same
      stature, the same voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But their thoughts? degree of intelligence? their knowledge of human
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is inequality there, I admit, monseigneur. Yes; for the prisoner of
      the Bastile is, most incontestably, superior in every way to his brother;
      and if, from his prison, this unhappy victim were to pass to the throne,
      France would not, from the earliest period of its history, perhaps, have
      had a master more powerful in genius and nobility of character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet buried his face in his hands, as if he were overwhelmed by the
      weight of this immense secret. Aramis approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a further inequality,&rdquo; he said, continuing his work of
      temptation, &ldquo;an inequality which concerns yourself, monseigneur, between
      the twins, both sons of Louis XIII., namely, the last comer does not know
      M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet raised his head immediately&mdash;his features were pale and
      distorted. The bolt had hit its mark&mdash;not his heart, but his mind and
      comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; he said to Aramis; &ldquo;you are proposing a conspiracy to
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of those attempts which, as you said at the beginning of this
      conversation, alters the fate of empires?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of superintendents, too; yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a word, you propose that I should agree to the substitution of the son
      of Louis XIII., who is now a prisoner in the Bastile, for the son of Louis
      XIII., who is at this moment asleep in the Chamber of Morpheus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis smiled with the sinister expression of the sinister thought which
      was passing through his brain. &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought,&rdquo; continued Fouquet, becoming animated with that
      strength of talent which in a few seconds originates, and matures the
      conception of a plan, and with that largeness of view which foresees all
      consequences, and embraces every result at a glance&mdash;&ldquo;have you
      thought that we must assemble the nobility, the clergy, and the third
      estate of the realm; that we shall have to depose the reigning sovereign,
      to disturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of their dead father, to
      sacrifice the life, the honor of a woman, Anne of Austria, the life and
      peace of mind and heart of another woman, Maria Theresa; and suppose that
      it were all done, if we were to succeed in doing it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; continued Aramis, coldly. &ldquo;There is not a
      single syllable of sense in all you have just said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the superintendent, surprised, &ldquo;a man like you refuse to view
      the practical bearing of the case! Do you confine yourself to the childish
      delight of a political illusion, and neglect the chances of its being
      carried into execution; in other words, the reality itself, is it
      possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Aramis, emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful
      familiarity, &ldquo;what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for
      another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet&mdash;&ldquo;Heaven gives directions to its agent,
      who seizes upon the doomed victim, hurries him away, and seats the
      triumphant rival on the empty throne. But you forget that this agent is
      called death. Oh! Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, tell me if you
      have had the idea&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question of that, monseigneur; you are going beyond the
      object in view. Who spoke of Louis XIV.&lsquo;s death? who spoke of adopting the
      example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution of its
      decrees? No, I wish you to understand that Heaven effects its purposes
      without confusion or disturbance, without exciting comment or remark,
      without difficulty or exertion; and that men, inspired by Heaven, succeed
      like Heaven itself, in all their undertakings, in all they attempt, in all
      they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, my <i>friend</i>,&rdquo; returned Aramis, with the same intonation on
      the word friend that he had applied to it the first time&mdash;&ldquo;I mean
      that if there has been any confusion, scandal, and even effort in the
      substitution of the prisoner for the king, I defy you to prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Fouquet, whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped
      his temples, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the king&rsquo;s apartment,&rdquo; continued Aramis, tranquilly, &ldquo;and you who
      know the mystery, I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the
      Bastile is lying in his brother&rsquo;s bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the king,&rdquo; stammered Fouquet, seized with horror at the intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What king?&rdquo; said Aramis, in his gentlest tone; &ldquo;the one who hates you, or
      the one who likes you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king&mdash;of&mdash;<i>yesterday</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king of yesterday! be quite easy on that score; he has gone to take
      the place in the Bastile which his victim occupied for so many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God! And who took him there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and in the simplest way. I carried him away last night. While he was
      descending into midnight, the other was ascending into day. I do not think
      there has been any disturbance whatever. A flash of lightning without
      thunder awakens nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet uttered a thick, smothered cry, as if he had been struck by some
      invisible blow, and clasping his head between his clenched hands, he
      murmured: &ldquo;You did that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cleverly enough, too; what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dethroned the king? imprisoned him, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that has been done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such an action was committed <i>here</i>, at Vaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here, at Vaux, in the Chamber of Morpheus. It would almost seem that
      it had been built in anticipation of such an act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at what time did it occur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon
      Aramis; he restrained himself. &ldquo;At Vaux; under my roof!&rdquo; he said, in a
      half-strangled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so! for it is still your house, and it is likely to continue
      so, since M. Colbert cannot rob you of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was under my roof, then, monsieur, that you committed this crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This crime?&rdquo; said Aramis, stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This abominable crime!&rdquo; pursued Fouquet, becoming more and more excited;
      &ldquo;this crime more execrable than an assassination! this crime which
      dishonors my name forever, and entails upon me the horror of posterity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in your senses, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Aramis, in an irresolute
      tone of voice; &ldquo;you are speaking too loudly; take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call out so loudly, that the whole world shall hear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Fouquet, take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet turned round towards the prelate, whom he looked at full in the
      face. &ldquo;You have dishonored me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in committing so foul an act of
      treason, so heinous a crime upon my guest, upon one who was peacefully
      reposing beneath my roof. Oh! woe, woe is me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woe to the man, rather, who beneath your roof meditated the ruin of your
      fortune, your life. Do you forget that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my guest, my sovereign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis rose, his eyes literally bloodshot, his mouth trembling
      convulsively. &ldquo;Have I a man out of his senses to deal with?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an honorable man to deal with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who will prevent you consummating your crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who would sooner, oh! far sooner, die; who would kill you even,
      rather than allow you to complete his dishonor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Fouquet snatched up his sword, which D&rsquo;Artagnan had placed at the head
      of his bed, and clenched it resolutely in his hand. Aramis frowned, and
      thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a weapon. This movement
      did not escape Fouquet, who, full of nobleness and pride in his
      magnanimity, threw his sword to a distance from him, and approached Aramis
      so close as to touch his shoulder with his disarmed hand. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I would sooner die here on the spot than survive this terrible
      disgrace; and if you have any pity left for me, I entreat you to take my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis remained silent and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not reply?&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis raised his head gently, and a glimmer of hope might be seen once
      more to animate his eyes. &ldquo;Reflect, monseigneur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;upon
      everything we have to expect. As the matter now stands, the king is still
      alive, and his imprisonment saves your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fouquet, &ldquo;you may have been acting on my behalf, but I will
      not, do not, accept your services. But, first of all, I do not wish your
      ruin. You will leave this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof,&rdquo; continued
      Fouquet, with an air of inexpressible majesty; &ldquo;you will not be more
      fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be so,&rdquo; said Aramis, in a hoarse, prophetic voice, &ldquo;you will be
      so, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the augury, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay; but nothing shall prevent me,
      nothing shall stop me. You will leave Vaux&mdash;you must leave France; I
      give you four hours to place yourself out of the king&rsquo;s reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hours?&rdquo; said Aramis, scornfully and incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon the word of Fouquet, no one shall follow you before the expiration
      of that time. You will therefore have four hours&rsquo; advance of those whom
      the king may wish to dispatch after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hours!&rdquo; repeated Aramis, in a thick, smothered voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to
      Belle-Isle, which I give you as a place of refuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belle-Isle is as much mine for you, as Vaux is mine for the king. Go,
      D&rsquo;Herblay, go! as long as I live, not a hair of your head shall be
      injured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Aramis, with a cold irony of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go at once, then, and give me your hand, before we both hasten away; you
      to save your life, I to save my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis withdrew from his breast the hand he had concealed there; it was
      stained with his blood. He had dug his nails into his flesh, as if in
      punishment for having nursed so many projects, more vain, insensate, and
      fleeting than the life of the man himself. Fouquet was horror-stricken,
      and then his heart smote him with pity. He threw open his arms as if to
      embrace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no arms,&rdquo; murmured Aramis, as wild and terrible in his wrath as the
      shade of Dido. And then, without touching Fouquet&rsquo;s hand, he turned his
      head aside, and stepped back a pace or two. His last word was an
      imprecation, his last gesture a curse, which his blood-stained hand seemed
      to invoke, as it sprinkled on Fouquet&rsquo;s face a few drops of blood which
      flowed from his breast. And both of them darted out of the room by the
      secret staircase which led down to the inner courtyard. Fouquet ordered
      his best horses, while Aramis paused at the foot of the staircase which
      led to Porthos&rsquo;s apartment. He reflected profoundly and for some time,
      while Fouquet&rsquo;s carriage left the courtyard at full gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go alone?&rdquo; said Aramis to himself, &ldquo;or warn the prince? Oh! fury!
      Warn the prince, and then&mdash;do what? Take him with me? To carry this
      accusing witness about with me everywhere? War, too, would follow&mdash;civil
      war, implacable in its nature! And without any resource save myself&mdash;it
      is impossible! What could he do without me? Oh! without me he will be
      utterly destroyed. Yet who knows&mdash;let destiny be fulfilled&mdash;condemned
      he was, let him remain so then! Good or evil Spirit&mdash;gloomy and
      scornful Power, whom men call the genius of humanity, thou art a power
      more restlessly uncertain, more baselessly useless, than wild mountain
      wind! Chance, thou term&rsquo;st thyself, but thou art nothing; thou inflamest
      everything with thy breath, crumblest mountains at thy approach, and
      suddenly art thyself destroyed at the presence of the Cross of dead wood
      behind which stand another Power invisible like thyself&mdash;whom thou
      deniest, perhaps, but whose avenging hand is on thee, and hurls thee in
      the dust dishonored and unnamed! Lost!&mdash;I am lost! What can be done?
      Flee to Belle-Isle? Yes, and leave Porthos behind me, to talk and relate
      the whole affair to every one! Porthos, too, who will have to suffer for
      what he has done. I will not let poor Porthos suffer. He seems like one of
      the members of my own frame; and his grief or misfortune would be mine as
      well. Porthos shall leave with me, and shall follow my destiny. It must be
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Aramis, apprehensive of meeting any one to whom his hurried movements
      might appear suspicious, ascended the staircase without being perceived.
      Porthos, so recently returned from Paris, was already in a profound sleep;
      his huge body forgot its fatigue, as his mind forgot its thoughts. Aramis
      entered, light as a shadow, and placed his nervous grasp on the giant&rsquo;s
      shoulder. &ldquo;Come, Porthos,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos obeyed, rose from his bed, opened his eyes, even before his
      intelligence seemed to be aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We leave immediately,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall go mounted, and faster than we have ever gone in our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; repeated Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress yourself, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he helped the giant to dress himself, and thrust his gold and diamonds
      into his pocket. Whilst he was thus engaged, a slight noise attracted his
      attention, and on looking up, he saw D&rsquo;Artagnan watching them through the
      half-opened door. Aramis started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?&rdquo; said the
      musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going off on a mission of great importance,&rdquo; added the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very fortunate,&rdquo; said the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;I feel so wearied; I would far sooner have
      been fast asleep. But the service of the king....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen M. Fouquet?&rdquo; said Aramis to D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this very minute, in a carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Adieu;&rsquo; nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else do you think he could say? Am I worth anything now, since you
      have got into such high favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Aramis, embracing the musketeer; &ldquo;your good times are
      returning again. You will have no occasion to be jealous of any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I predict that something will happen to you to-day which will increase
      your importance more than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I know all the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Porthos, are you ready? Let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite ready, Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us embrace D&rsquo;Artagnan first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there is no want of them here. Will you have mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Porthos has his own stud. So adieu! adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fugitives mounted their horses beneath the very eyes of the captain of
      the musketeers, who held Porthos&rsquo;s stirrup for him, and gazed after them
      until they were out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On any other occasion,&rdquo; thought the Gascon, &ldquo;I should say that those
      gentlemen were making their escape; but in these days politics seem so
      changed that such an exit is termed going on a mission. I have no
      objection; let me attend to my own affairs, that is more than enough for
      <i>me</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and he philosophically entered his apartments.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXII. Showing How the Countersign Was Respected at the Bastile.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fouquet tore along as fast as his horses could drag him. On his way he
      trembled with horror at the idea of what had just been revealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must have been,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the youth of those extraordinary men,
      who, even as age is stealing fast upon them, are still able to conceive
      such gigantic plans, and carry them through without a tremor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At one moment he could not resist the idea that all Aramis had just been
      recounting to him was nothing more than a dream, and whether the fable
      itself was not the snare; so that when Fouquet arrived at the Bastile, he
      might possibly find an order of arrest, which would send him to join the
      dethroned king. Strongly impressed with this idea, he gave certain sealed
      orders on his route, while fresh horses were being harnessed to his
      carriage. These orders were addressed to M. d&rsquo;Artagnan and to certain
      others whose fidelity to the king was far above suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way,&rdquo; said Fouquet to himself, &ldquo;prisoner or not, I shall have
      performed the duty that I owe my honor. The orders will not reach them
      until after my return, if I should return free, and consequently they will
      not have been unsealed. I shall take them back again. If I am delayed; it
      will be because some misfortune will have befallen me; and in that case
      assistance will be sent for me as well as for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prepared in this manner, the superintendent arrived at the Bastile; he had
      traveled at the rate of five leagues and a half the hour. Every
      circumstance of delay which Aramis had escaped in his visit to the Bastile
      befell Fouquet. It was useless giving his name, equally useless his being
      recognized; he could not succeed in obtaining an entrance. By dint of
      entreaties, threats, commands, he succeeded in inducing a sentinel to
      speak to one of the subalterns, who went and told the major. As for the
      governor they did not even dare disturb him. Fouquet sat in his carriage,
      at the outer gate of the fortress, chafing with rage and impatience,
      awaiting the return of the officers, who at last re-appeared with a
      sufficiently sulky air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Fouquet, impatiently, &ldquo;what did the major say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the soldier, &ldquo;the major laughed in my face. He
      told me that M. Fouquet was at Vaux, and that even were he at Paris, M.
      Fouquet would not get up at so early an hour as the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordieu!</i> you are an absolute set of fools,&rdquo; cried the minister,
      darting out of the carriage; and before the subaltern had time to shut the
      gate, Fouquet sprang through it, and ran forward in spite of the soldier,
      who cried out for assistance. Fouquet gained ground, regardless of the
      cries of the man, who, however, having at last come up with Fouquet,
      called out to the sentinel of the second gate, &ldquo;Look out, look out,
      sentinel!&rdquo; The man crossed his pike before the minister; but the latter,
      robust and active, and hurried away, too, by his passion, wrested the pike
      from the soldier and struck him a violent blow on the shoulder with it.
      The subaltern, who approached too closely, received a share of the blows
      as well. Both of them uttered loud and furious cries, at the sound of
      which the whole of the first body of the advanced guard poured out of the
      guardhouse. Among them there was one, however, who recognized the
      superintendent, and who called, &ldquo;Monseigneur, ah! monseigneur. Stop, stop,
      you fellows!&rdquo; And he effectually checked the soldiers, who were on the
      point of revenging their companions. Fouquet desired them to open the
      gate, but they refused to do so without the countersign; he desired them
      to inform the governor of his presence; but the latter had already heard
      the disturbance at the gate. He ran forward, followed by his major, and
      accompanied by a picket of twenty men, persuaded that an attack was being
      made on the Bastile. Baisemeaux also recognized Fouquet immediately, and
      dropped the sword he bravely had been brandishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monseigneur,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;how can I excuse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the superintendent, flushed with anger, and heated by his
      exertions, &ldquo;I congratulate you. Your watch and ward are admirably kept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux turned pale, thinking that this remark was made ironically, and
      portended a furious burst of anger. But Fouquet had recovered his breath,
      and, beckoning the sentinel and the subaltern, who were rubbing their
      shoulders, towards him, he said, &ldquo;There are twenty pistoles for the
      sentinel, and fifty for the officer. Pray receive my compliments,
      gentlemen. I will not fail to speak to his majesty about you. And now, M.
      Baisemeaux, a word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he followed the governor to his official residence, accompanied by a
      murmur of general satisfaction. Baisemeaux was already trembling with
      shame and uneasiness. Aramis&rsquo;s early visit, from that moment, seemed to
      possess consequences, which a functionary such as he (Baisemeaux) was, was
      perfectly justified in apprehending. It was quite another thing, however,
      when Fouquet in a sharp tone of voice, and with an imperious look, said,
      &ldquo;You have seen M. d&rsquo;Herblay this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you not horrified at the crime of which you have made yourself an
      accomplice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Baisemeaux, &ldquo;good so far;&rdquo; and then he added, aloud, &ldquo;But
      what crime, monseigneur, do you allude to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That for which you can be quartered alive, monsieur&mdash;do not forget
      that! But this is not a time to show anger. Conduct me immediately to the
      prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what prisoner?&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pretend to be ignorant? Very good&mdash;it is the best plan for you,
      perhaps; for if, in fact, you were to admit your participation in such a
      crime, it would be all over with you. I wish, therefore, to seem to
      believe in your assumption of ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you, monseigneur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do. Lead me to the prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Marchiali?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Marchiali?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prisoner who was brought back this morning by M. d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is called Marchiali?&rdquo; said the superintendent, his conviction somewhat
      shaken by Baisemeaux&rsquo;s cool manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur; that is the name under which he was inscribed here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet looked steadily at Baisemeaux, as if he would read his very heart;
      and perceived, with that clear-sightedness most men possess who are
      accustomed to the exercise of power, that the man was speaking with
      perfect sincerity. Besides, in observing his face for a few moments, he
      could not believe that Aramis would have chosen such a confidant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the prisoner,&rdquo; said the superintendent to him, &ldquo;whom M. d&rsquo;Herblay
      carried away the day before yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom he brought back this morning?&rdquo; added Fouquet, quickly: for he
      understood immediately the mechanism of Aramis&rsquo;s plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name is Marchiali, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Marchiali. If monseigneur has come here to remove him, so much the
      better, for I was going to write about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since this morning he has annoyed me extremely. He has had such
      terrible fits of passion, as almost to make me believe that he would bring
      the Bastile itself down about our ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will soon relieve you of his possession,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conduct me to his prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will monseigneur give me the order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An order from the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until I sign you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not be sufficient, monseigneur. I must have an order from the
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet assumed an irritated expression. &ldquo;As you are so scrupulous,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;with regard to allowing prisoners to leave, show me the order by
      which this one was set at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux showed him the order to release Seldon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Fouquet; &ldquo;but Seldon is not Marchiali.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Marchiali is not at liberty, monseigneur; he is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said that M. d&rsquo;Herblay carried him away and brought him back
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So surely did you say it, that I almost seem to hear it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a slip of my tongue, then, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, M. Baisemeaux, take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to fear, monseigneur; I am acting according to the very
      strictest regulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would say so in the presence of one of the apostles. M. d&rsquo;Herblay
      brought me an order to set Seldon at liberty. Seldon is free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that Marchiali has left the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must prove that, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, monseigneur, who govern this kingdom, know very well that no one can
      see any of the prisoners without an express order from the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay has entered, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be proved, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Baisemeaux, once more I warn you to pay particular attention to
      what you are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the documents are there, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay is overthrown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Overthrown?&mdash;M. d&rsquo;Herblay! Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that he has undoubtedly influenced you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monseigneur; what does, in fact, influence me, is the king&rsquo;s service.
      I am doing my duty. Give me an order from him, and you shall enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, M. le gouverneur, I give you my word that if you allow me to see
      the prisoner, I will give you an order from the king at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me now, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that, if you refuse me, I will have you and all your officers
      arrested on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you commit such an act of violence, monseigneur, you will
      reflect,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, who had turned very pale, &ldquo;that we will only
      obey an order signed by the king; and that it will be just as easy for you
      to obtain one to see Marchiali as to obtain one to do me so much injury;
      me, too, who am perfectly innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. True!&rdquo; cried Fouquet, furiously; &ldquo;perfectly true. M. de
      Baisemeaux,&rdquo; he added, in a sonorous voice, drawing the unhappy governor
      towards him, &ldquo;do you know why I am so anxious to speak to the prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monseigneur; and allow me to observe that you are terrifying me out
      of my senses; I am trembling all over&mdash;in fact, I feel as though I
      were about to faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will stand a better chance of fainting outright, Monsieur Baisemeaux,
      when I return here at the head of ten thousand men and thirty pieces of
      cannon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, monseigneur, you are losing your senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have roused the whole population of Paris against you and your
      accursed towers, and have battered open the gates of this place, and
      hanged you to the topmost tree of yonder pinnacle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur! monseigneur! for pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you ten minutes to make up your mind,&rdquo; added Fouquet, in a calm
      voice. &ldquo;I will sit down here, in this armchair, and wait for you; if, in
      ten minutes&rsquo; time, you still persist, I leave this place, and you may
      think me as mad as you like. Then&mdash;you shall <i>see!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux stamped his foot on the ground like a man in a state of
      despair, but he did not reply a single syllable; whereupon Fouquet seized
      a pen and ink, and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order for M. le Prevot des Marchands to assemble the municipal guard and
      to march upon the Bastile on the king&rsquo;s immediate service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux shrugged his shoulders. Fouquet wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order for the Duc de Bouillon and M. le Prince de Conde to assume the
      command of the Swiss guards, of the king&rsquo;s guards, and to march upon the
      Bastile on the king&rsquo;s immediate service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux reflected. Fouquet still wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order for every soldier, citizen, or gentleman to seize and apprehend,
      wherever he may be found, le Chevalier d&rsquo;Herblay, Eveque de Vannes, and
      his accomplices, who are: first, M. de Baisemeaux, governor of the
      Bastile, suspected of the crimes of high treason and rebellion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, monseigneur!&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux; &ldquo;I do not understand a single jot
      of the whole matter; but so many misfortunes, even were it madness itself
      that had set them at their awful work, might happen here in a couple of
      hours, that the king, by whom I must be judged, will see whether I have
      been wrong in withdrawing the countersign before this flood of imminent
      catastrophes. Come with me to the keep, monseigneur, you shall see
      Marchiali.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet darted out of the room, followed by Baisemeaux as he wiped the
      perspiration from his face. &ldquo;What a terrible morning!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what a
      disgrace for <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk faster,&rdquo; replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux made a sign to the jailer to precede them. He was afraid of his
      companion, which the latter could not fail to perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to this child&rsquo;s play,&rdquo; he said, roughly. &ldquo;Let the man remain
      here; take the keys yourself, and show me the way. Not a single person, do
      you understand, must hear what is going to take place here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, undecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again!&rdquo; cried M. Fouquet. &ldquo;Ah! say &lsquo;no&rsquo; at once, and I will leave the
      Bastile and will myself carry my own dispatches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux bowed his head, took the keys, and unaccompanied, except by the
      minister, ascended the staircase. The higher they advanced up the spiral
      staircase, the more clearly did certain muffled murmurs become distinct
      appeals and fearful imprecations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your Marchiali,&rdquo; said the governor; &ldquo;this is the way these madmen
      scream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he accompanied that reply with a glance more pregnant with injurious
      allusion, as far as Fouquet was concerned, than politeness. The latter
      trembled; he had just recognized in one cry more terrible than any that
      had preceded it, the king&rsquo;s voice. He paused on the staircase, snatching
      the bunch of keys from Baisemeaux, who thought this new madman was going
      to dash out his brains with one of them. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay did
      not say a word about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the keys at once!&rdquo; cried Fouquet, tearing them from his hand.
      &ldquo;Which is the key of the door I am to open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fearful cry, followed by a violent blow against the door, made the whole
      staircase resound with the echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave this place,&rdquo; said Fouquet to Baisemeaux, in a threatening tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask nothing better,&rdquo; murmured the latter, to himself. &ldquo;There will be a
      couple of madmen face to face, and the one will kill the other, I am
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; repeated Fouquet. &ldquo;If you place your foot on this staircase before I
      call you, remember that you shall take the place of the meanest prisoner
      in the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This job will kill me, I am sure it will,&rdquo; muttered Baisemeaux, as he
      withdrew with tottering steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner&rsquo;s cries became more and more terrible. When Fouquet had
      satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the staircase,
      he inserted the key in the first lock. It was then that he heard the
      hoarse, choking voice of the king, crying out, in a frenzy of rage, &ldquo;Help,
      help! I am the king.&rdquo; The key of the second door was not the same as the
      first, and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on the bunch. The king,
      however, furious and almost mad with rage and passion, shouted at the top
      of his voice, &ldquo;It was M. Fouquet who brought me here. Help me against M.
      Fouquet! I am the king! Help the king against M. Fouquet!&rdquo; These cries
      filled the minister&rsquo;s heart with terrible emotions. They were followed by
      a shower of blows leveled against the door with a part of the broken chair
      with which the king had armed himself. Fouquet at last succeeded in
      finding the key. The king was almost exhausted; he could hardly articulate
      distinctly as he shouted, &ldquo;Death to Fouquet! death to the traitor
      Fouquet!&rdquo; The door flew open.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIII. The King&rsquo;s Gratitude.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they
      suddenly and abruptly stopped, as a mutual recognition took place, and
      each uttered a cry of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come to assassinate me, monsieur?&rdquo; said the king, when he
      recognized Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king in this state!&rdquo; murmured the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young
      prince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him; his clothes were in
      tatters; his shirt, open and torn to rags, was stained with sweat and with
      the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms. Haggard,
      ghastly pale, his hair in disheveled masses, Louis XIV. presented the most
      perfect picture of despair, distress, anger and fear combined that could
      possibly be united in one figure. Fouquet was so touched, so affected and
      disturbed by it, that he ran towards him with his arms stretched out and
      his eyes filled with tears. Louis held up the massive piece of wood of
      which he had made such a furious use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Fouquet, in a voice trembling with emotion, &ldquo;do you not
      recognize the most faithful of your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend&mdash;you!&rdquo; repeated Louis, gnashing his teeth in a manner which
      betrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most respectful of your servants,&rdquo; added Fouquet, throwing himself on
      his knees. The king let the rude weapon fall from his grasp. Fouquet
      approached him, kissed his knees, and took him in his arms with
      inconceivable tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My king, my child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how you must have suffered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis, recalled to himself by the change of situation, looked at himself,
      and ashamed of the disordered state of his apparel, ashamed of his
      conduct, and ashamed of the air of pity and protection that was shown
      towards him, drew back. Fouquet did not understand this movement; he did
      not perceive that the king&rsquo;s feeling of pride would never forgive him for
      having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free?&rdquo; repeated the king. &ldquo;Oh! you set me at liberty, then, after having
      dared to lift up your hand against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not believe that!&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet, indignantly; &ldquo;you cannot
      believe me to be guilty of such an act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And rapidly, warmly even, he related the whole particulars of the
      intrigue, the details of which are already known to the reader. While the
      recital continued, Louis suffered the most horrible anguish of mind; and
      when it was finished, the magnitude of the danger he had run struck him
      far more than the importance of the secret relative to his twin brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, suddenly to Fouquet, &ldquo;this double birth is a
      falsehood; it is impossible&mdash;you cannot have been the dupe of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible, I tell you, that the honor, the virtue of my mother can
      be suspected, and my first minister has not yet done justice on the
      criminals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect, sire, before you are hurried away by anger,&rdquo; replied Fouquet.
      &ldquo;The birth of your brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one brother&mdash;and that is Monsieur. You know it as well
      as myself. There is a plot, I tell you, beginning with the governor of the
      Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful, sire, for this man has been deceived as every one else has by
      the prince&rsquo;s likeness to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likeness? Absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Marchiali must be singularly like your majesty, to be able to
      deceive every one&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; Fouquet persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say so, sire; those who had prepared everything in order to face
      and deceive your ministers, your mother, your officers of state, the
      members of your family, must be quite confident of the resemblance between
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are these persons, then?&rdquo; murmured the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Vaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Vaux! and you suffer them to remain there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My most instant duty appeared to me to be your majesty&rsquo;s release. I have
      accomplished that duty; and now, whatever your majesty may command, shall
      be done. I await your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis reflected for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muster all the troops in Paris,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the necessary orders are given for that purpose,&rdquo; replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given orders!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that purpose, yes, sire; your majesty will be at the head of ten
      thousand men in less than an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only reply the king made was to take hold of Fouquet&rsquo;s hand with such
      an expression of feeling, that it was very easy to perceive how strongly
      he had, until that remark, maintained his suspicions of the minister,
      notwithstanding the latter&rsquo;s intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with these troops,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we shall go at once and besiege in your
      house the rebels who by this time will have established and intrenched
      themselves therein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be surprised if that were the case,&rdquo; replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because their chief&mdash;the very soul of the enterprise&mdash;having
      been unmasked by me, the whole plan seems to me to have miscarried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have unmasked this false prince also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom have you seen, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The leader of the enterprise, not that unhappy young man; the latter is
      merely an instrument, destined through his whole life to wretchedness, I
      plainly perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is M. l&rsquo;Abbe d&rsquo;Herblay, Eveque de Vannes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my friend, sire,&rdquo; replied Fouquet, nobly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unfortunate circumstance for you,&rdquo; said the king, in a less generous
      tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such friendships, sire, had nothing dishonorable in them so long as I was
      ignorant of the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have foreseen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am guilty, I place myself in your majesty&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Monsieur Fouquet, it was not that I meant,&rdquo; returned the king, sorry
      to have shown the bitterness of his thought in such a manner. &ldquo;Well! I
      assure you that, notwithstanding the mask with which the villain covered
      his face, I had something like a vague suspicion that he was the very man.
      But with this chief of the enterprise there was a man of prodigious
      strength, the one who menaced me with a force almost herculean; what is
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be his friend the Baron du Vallon, formerly one of the
      musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The friend of D&rsquo;Artagnan? the friend of the Comte de la Fere? Ah!&rdquo;
       exclaimed the king, as he paused at the name of the latter, &ldquo;we must not
      forget the connection that existed between the conspirators and M. de
      Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, sire, do not go too far. M. de la Fere is the most honorable man in
      France. Be satisfied with those whom I deliver up to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With those whom you deliver up to me, you say? Very good, for you will
      deliver up those who are guilty to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your majesty understand by that?&rdquo; inquired Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;that we shall soon arrive at Vaux with
      a large body of troops, that we will lay violent hands upon that nest of
      vipers, and that not a soul shall escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty will put these men to death!&rdquo; cried Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the very meanest of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us understand one another, Monsieur Fouquet,&rdquo; said the king,
      haughtily. &ldquo;We no longer live in times when assassination was the only and
      the last resource kings held in reservation at extremity. No, Heaven be
      praised! I have parliaments who sit and judge in my name, and I have
      scaffolds on which supreme authority is carried out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet turned pale. &ldquo;I will take the liberty of observing to your
      majesty, that any proceedings instituted respecting these matters would
      bring down the greatest scandal upon the dignity of the throne. The august
      name of Anne of Austria must never be allowed to pass the lips of the
      people accompanied by a smile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Justice must be done, however, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, sire; but royal blood must not be shed upon a scaffold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The royal blood! you believe that!&rdquo; cried the king with fury in his
      voice, stamping his foot on the ground. &ldquo;This double birth is an
      invention; and in that invention, particularly, do I see M. d&rsquo;Herblay&rsquo;s
      crime. It is the crime I wish to punish rather than the violence, or the
      insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And punish it with death, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With death; yes, monsieur, I have said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the surintendant, with firmness, as he raised his head
      proudly, &ldquo;your majesty will take the life, if you please, of your brother
      Philippe of France; that concerns you alone, and you will doubtless
      consult the queen-mother upon the subject. Whatever she may command will
      be perfectly correct. I do not wish to mix myself up in it, not even for
      the honor of your crown, but I have a favor to ask of you, and I beg to
      submit it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said the king, in no little degree agitated by his minister&rsquo;s
      last words. &ldquo;What do you require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pardon of M. d&rsquo;Herblay and of M. du Vallon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My assassins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two rebels, sire, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I understand, then, you ask me to forgive your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends!&rdquo; said Fouquet, deeply wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friends, certainly; but the safety of the state requires that an
      exemplary punishment should be inflicted on the guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not permit myself to remind your majesty that I have just restored
      you to liberty, and have saved your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not allow myself to remind your majesty that had M. d&rsquo;Herblay
      wished to carry out his character of an assassin, he could very easily
      have assassinated your majesty this morning in the forest of Senart, and
      all would have been over.&rdquo; The king started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pistol-bullet through the head,&rdquo; pursued Fouquet, &ldquo;and the disfigured
      features of Louis XIV., which no one could have recognized, would be M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay&rsquo;s complete and entire justification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king turned pale and giddy at the bare idea of the danger he had
      escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If M. d&rsquo;Herblay,&rdquo; continued Fouquet, &ldquo;had been an assassin, he had no
      occasion to inform me of his plan in order to succeed. Freed from the real
      king, it would have been impossible in all futurity to guess the false.
      And if the usurper had been recognized by Anne of Austria, he would still
      have been&mdash;her son. The usurper, as far as Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay&rsquo;s
      conscience was concerned, was still a king of the blood of Louis XIII.
      Moreover, the conspirator, in that course, would have had security,
      secrecy, impunity. A pistol-bullet would have procured him all that. For
      the sake of Heaven, sire, grant me his forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, instead of being touched by the picture, so faithfully drawn in
      all details, of Aramis&rsquo;s generosity, felt himself most painfully and
      cruelly humiliated. His unconquerable pride revolted at the idea that a
      man had held suspended at the end of his finger the thread of his royal
      life. Every word that fell from Fouquet&rsquo;s lips, and which he thought most
      efficacious in procuring his friend&rsquo;s pardon, seemed to pour another drop
      of poison into the already ulcerated heart of Louis XIV. Nothing could
      bend or soften him. Addressing himself to Fouquet, he said, &ldquo;I really
      don&rsquo;t know, monsieur, why you should solicit the pardon of these men. What
      good is there in asking that which can be obtained without solicitation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not difficult, either. Where am I now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Bastile, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in a dungeon. I am looked upon as a madman, am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one is known here but Marchiali?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; change nothing in the position of affairs. Let the poor madman rot
      between the slimy walls of the Bastile, and M. d&rsquo;Herblay and M. du Vallon
      will stand in no need of my forgiveness. Their new king will absolve
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty does me a great injustice, sire; and you are wrong,&rdquo; replied
      Fouquet, dryly; &ldquo;I am not child enough, nor is M. d&rsquo;Herblay silly enough,
      to have omitted to make all these reflections; and if I had wished to make
      a new king, as you say, I had no occasion to have come here to force open
      the gates and doors of the Bastile, to free you from this place. That
      would show a want of even common sense. Your majesty&rsquo;s mind is disturbed
      by anger; otherwise you would be far from offending, groundlessly, the
      very one of your servants who has rendered you the most important service
      of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis perceived that he had gone too far; that the gates of the Bastile
      were still closed upon him, whilst, by degrees, the floodgates were
      gradually being opened, behind which the generous-hearted Fouquet had
      restrained his anger. &ldquo;I did not say that to humiliate you, Heaven knows,
      monsieur,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Only you are addressing yourself to me in order to
      obtain a pardon, and I answer according to my conscience. And so, judging
      by my conscience, the criminals we speak of are not worthy of
      consideration or forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I do is as generous,&rdquo; added the king, &ldquo;as what you have done, for I
      am in your power. I will even say it is more generous, inasmuch as you
      place before me certain conditions upon which my liberty, my life, may
      depend; and to reject which is to make a sacrifice of both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wrong, certainly,&rdquo; replied Fouquet. &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;I had the
      appearance of extorting a favor; I regret it, and entreat your majesty&rsquo;s
      forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are forgiven, my dear Monsieur Fouquet,&rdquo; said the king, with a
      smile, which restored the serene expression of his features, which so many
      circumstances had altered since the preceding evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my own forgiveness,&rdquo; replied the minister, with some degree of
      persistence; &ldquo;but M. d&rsquo;Herblay, and M. du Vallon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will never obtain theirs, as long as I live,&rdquo; replied the inflexible
      king. &ldquo;Do me the kindness not to speak of it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty shall be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will bear me no ill-will for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, sire; for I anticipated the event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had &lsquo;anticipated&rsquo; that I should refuse to forgive those gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; and all my measures were taken in consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean to say?&rdquo; cried the king, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay came, as may be said, to deliver himself into my hands. M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay left to me the happiness of saving my king and my country. I
      could not condemn M. d&rsquo;Herblay to death; nor could I, on the other hand,
      expose him to your majesty&rsquo;s justifiable wrath; it would have been just
      the same as if I had killed him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! and what have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I gave M. d&rsquo;Herblay the best horses in my stables and four hours&rsquo;
      start over all those your majesty might, probably, dispatch after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so!&rdquo; murmured the king. &ldquo;But still, the world is wide enough and
      large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses,
      notwithstanding the &lsquo;four hours&rsquo; start&rsquo; which you have given to M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In giving him these four hours, sire, I knew I was giving him his life,
      and he will save his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After having galloped as hard as possible, with the four hours&rsquo; start,
      before your musketeers, he will reach my chateau of Belle-Isle, where I
      have given him a safe asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be! But you forget that you have made me a present of
      Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not for you to arrest my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take it back again, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as that goes&mdash;yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My musketeers shall capture it, and the affair will be at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither your musketeers, nor your whole army could take Belle-Isle,&rdquo; said
      Fouquet, coldly. &ldquo;Belle-Isle is impregnable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king became perfectly livid; a lightning flash seemed to dart from his
      eyes. Fouquet felt that he was lost, but he as not one to shrink when the
      voice of honor spoke loudly within him. He bore the king&rsquo;s wrathful gaze;
      the latter swallowed his rage, and after a few moments&rsquo; silence, said,
      &ldquo;Are we going to return to Vaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your majesty&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; replied Fouquet, with a low bow; &ldquo;but I
      think that your majesty can hardly dispense with changing your clothes
      previous to appearing before your court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall pass by the Louvre,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And they left the
      prison, passing before Baisemeaux, who looked completely bewildered as he
      saw Marchiali once more leave; and, in his helplessness, tore out the
      major portion of his few remaining hairs. It was perfectly true, however,
      that Fouquet wrote and gave him an authority for the prisoner&rsquo;s release,
      and that the king wrote beneath it, &ldquo;Seen and approved, Louis&rdquo;; a piece of
      madness that Baisemeaux, incapable of putting two ideas together,
      acknowledged by giving himself a terrible blow on the forehead with his
      own fist.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIV. The False King.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the meantime, usurped royalty was playing out its part bravely at Vaux.
      Philippe gave orders that for his <i>petit lever</i> the <i>grandes
      entrees</i>, already prepared to appear before the king, should be
      introduced. He determined to give this order notwithstanding the absence
      of M. d&rsquo;Herblay, who did not return&mdash;our readers know the reason. But
      the prince, not believing that absence could be prolonged, wished, as all
      rash spirits do, to try his valor and his fortune far from all protection
      and instruction. Another reason urged him to this&mdash;Anne of Austria
      was about to appear; the guilty mother was about to stand in the presence
      of her sacrificed son. Philippe was not willing, if he had a weakness, to
      render the man a witness of it before whom he was bound thenceforth to
      display so much strength. Philippe opened his folding doors, and several
      persons entered silently. Philippe did not stir whilst his <i>valets de
      chambre</i> dressed him. He had watched, the evening before, all the
      habits of his brother, and played the king in such a manner as to awaken
      no suspicion. He was thus completely dressed in hunting costume when he
      received his visitors. His own memory and the notes of Aramis announced
      everybody to him, first of all Anne of Austria, to whom Monsieur gave his
      hand, and then Madame with M. de Saint-Aignan. He smiled at seeing these
      countenances, but trembled on recognizing his mother. That still so noble
      and imposing figure, ravaged by pain, pleaded in his heart the cause of
      the famous queen who had immolated a child to reasons of state. He found
      his mother still handsome. He knew that Louis XIV. loved her, and he
      promised himself to love her likewise, and not to prove a scourge to her
      old age. He contemplated his brother with a tenderness easily to be
      understood. The latter had usurped nothing, had cast no shades athwart his
      life. A separate tree, he allowed the stem to rise without heeding its
      elevation or majestic life. Philippe promised himself to be a kind brother
      to this prince, who required nothing but gold to minister to his
      pleasures. He bowed with a friendly air to Saint-Aignan, who was all
      reverences and smiles, and trembling held out his hand to Henrietta, his
      sister-in-law, whose beauty struck him; but he saw in the eyes of that
      princess an expression of coldness which would facilitate, as he thought,
      their future relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much more easy,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;it will be to be the brother of that
      woman than her gallant, if she evinces towards me a coldness that my
      brother could not have for her, but which is imposed upon me as a duty.&rdquo;
       The only visit he dreaded at this moment was that of the queen; his heart&mdash;his
      mind&mdash;had just been shaken by so violent a trial, that, in spite of
      their firm temperament, they would not, perhaps, support another shock.
      Happily the queen did not come. Then commenced, on the part of Anne of
      Austria, a political dissertation upon the welcome M. Fouquet had given to
      the house of France. She mixed up hostilities with compliments addressed
      to the king, and questions as to his health, with little maternal
      flatteries and diplomatic artifices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my son,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;are you convinced with regard to M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Aignan,&rdquo; said Philippe, &ldquo;have the goodness to go and inquire after
      the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the first Philippe had pronounced aloud, the slight
      difference that there was between his voice and that of the king was
      sensible to maternal ears, and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her
      son. Saint-Aignan left the room, and Philippe continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of, you know I do not&mdash;and
      you have even spoken well of him yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true; therefore I only question you on the state of your
      sentiments with respect to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Henrietta, &ldquo;I, on my part, have always liked M. Fouquet. He
      is a man of good taste,&mdash;a superior man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A superintendent who is never sordid or niggardly,&rdquo; added Monsieur; &ldquo;and
      who pays in gold all the orders I have on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one in this thinks too much of himself, and nobody for the state,&rdquo;
       said the old queen. &ldquo;M. Fouquet, it is a fact, M. Fouquet is ruining the
      state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother!&rdquo; replied Philippe, in rather a lower key, &ldquo;do you likewise
      constitute yourself the buckler of M. Colbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; replied the old queen, rather surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in truth,&rdquo; replied Philippe, &ldquo;you speak that just as your old friend
      Madame de Chevreuse would speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you mention Madame de Chevreuse to me?&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and what sort
      of humor are you in to-day towards me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philippe continued: &ldquo;Is not Madame de Chevreuse always in league against
      somebody? Has not Madame de Chevreuse been to pay you a visit, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, you speak to me now in such a manner that I can almost fancy I
      am listening to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father did not like Madame de Chevreuse, and had good reason for not
      liking her,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;For my part, I like her no better than <i>he</i>
      did, and if she thinks proper to come here as she formerly did, to sow
      divisions and hatreds under the pretext of begging money&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what?&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, proudly, herself provoking the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; replied the young man firmly, &ldquo;I will drive Madame de Chevreuse
      out of my kingdom&mdash;and with her all who meddle with its secrets and
      mysteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not calculated the effect of this terrible speech, or perhaps he
      wished to judge the effect of it, like those who, suffering from a chronic
      pain, and seeking to break the monotony of that suffering, touch their
      wound to procure a sharper pang. Anne of Austria was nearly fainting; her
      eyes, open but meaningless, ceased to see for several seconds; she
      stretched out her arms towards her other son, who supported and embraced
      her without fear of irritating the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; murmured she, &ldquo;you are treating your mother very cruelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what respect, madame?&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I am only speaking of Madame de
      Chevreuse; does my mother prefer Madame de Chevreuse to the security of
      the state and of my person? Well, then, madame, I tell you Madame de
      Chevreuse has returned to France to borrow money, and that she addressed
      herself to M. Fouquet to sell him a certain secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain secret!&rdquo; cried Anne of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Concerning pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had
      committed, which is false,&rdquo; added Philippe. &ldquo;M. Fouquet rejected her
      offers with indignation, preferring the esteem of the king to complicity
      with such intriguers. Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M.
      Colbert, and as she is insatiable, and was not satisfied with having
      extorted a hundred thousand crowns from a servant of the state, she has
      taken a still bolder flight, in search of surer sources of supply. Is that
      true, madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all, sire,&rdquo; said the queen, more uneasy than irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Philippe, &ldquo;I have good reason to dislike this fury, who
      comes to my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others. If
      Heaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed, and has concealed them
      in the shadow of its clemency, I will not permit Madame de Chevreuse to
      counteract the just designs of fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother, that her
      son had pity on her. He took her hand and kissed it tenderly; she did not
      feel that in that kiss, given in spite of repulsion and bitterness of the
      heart, there was a pardon for eight years of suffering. Philippe allowed
      the silence of a moment to swallow the emotions that had just developed
      themselves. Then, with a cheerful smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not go to-day,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a plan.&rdquo; And, turning towards
      the door, he hoped to see Aramis, whose absence began to alarm him. The
      queen-mother wished to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain where you are, mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish you to make your peace
      with M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bear M. Fouquet no ill-will; I only dreaded his prodigalities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will put that to rights, and will take nothing of the superintendent
      but his good qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your majesty looking for?&rdquo; said Henrietta, seeing the king&rsquo;s eyes
      constantly turned towards the door, and wishing to let fly a little
      poisoned arrow at his heart, supposing he was so anxiously expecting
      either La Valliere or a letter from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; said the young man, who had divined her thought, thanks to
      that marvelous perspicuity of which fortune was from that time about to
      allow him the exercise, &ldquo;my sister, I am expecting a most distinguished
      man, a most able counselor, whom I wish to present to you all,
      recommending him to your good graces. Ah! come in, then, D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your majesty wish?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, appearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is monsieur the bishop of Vannes, your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting for him, and he does not come. Let him be sought for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan remained for an instant stupefied; but soon, reflecting that
      Aramis had left Vaux privately on a mission from the king, he concluded
      that the king wished to preserve the secret. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;does
      your majesty absolutely require M. d&rsquo;Herblay to be brought to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely is not the word,&rdquo; said Philippe; &ldquo;I do not want him so
      particularly as that; but if he can be found&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this M. d&rsquo;Herblay the bishop of Vannes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; an old musketeer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the four braves who formerly performed such prodigies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old queen repented of having wished to bite; she broke off the
      conversation, in order to preserve the rest of her teeth. &ldquo;Whatever may be
      your choice, sire,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have no doubt it will be excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All bowed in support of that sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find in him,&rdquo; continued Philippe, &ldquo;the depth and penetration of
      M. de Richelieu, without the avarice of M. de Mazarin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prime minister, sire?&rdquo; said Monsieur, in a fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all about that, brother; but it is strange that M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay is not here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let M. Fouquet be informed that I wish to speak to him&mdash;oh! before
      you, before you; do not retire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Saint-Aignan returned, bringing satisfactory news of the queen, who
      only kept her bed from precaution, and to have strength to carry out the
      king&rsquo;s wishes. Whilst everybody was seeking M. Fouquet and Aramis, the new
      king quietly continued his experiments, and everybody, family, officers,
      servants, had not the least suspicion of his identity, his air, his voice,
      and manners were so like the king&rsquo;s. On his side, Philippe, applying to
      all countenances the accurate descriptions and key-notes of character
      supplied by his accomplice Aramis, conducted himself so as not to give
      birth to a doubt in the minds of those who surrounded him. Nothing from
      that time could disturb the usurper. With what strange facility had
      Providence just reversed the loftiest fortune of the world to substitute
      the lowliest in its stead! Philippe admired the goodness of God with
      regard to himself, and seconded it with all the resources of his admirable
      nature. But he felt, at times, something like a specter gliding between
      him and the rays of his new glory. Aramis did not appear. The conversation
      had languished in the royal family; Philippe, preoccupied, forgot to
      dismiss his brother and Madame Henrietta. The latter were astonished, and
      began, by degrees, to lose all patience. Anne of Austria stooped towards
      her son&rsquo;s ear and addressed some words to him in Spanish. Philippe was
      completely ignorant of that language, and grew pale at this unexpected
      obstacle. But, as if the spirit of the imperturbable Aramis had covered
      him with his infallibility, instead of appearing disconcerted, Philippe
      rose. &ldquo;Well! what?&rdquo; said Anne of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all that noise?&rdquo; said Philippe, turning round towards the door of
      the second staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a voice was heard saying, &ldquo;This way, this way! A few steps more,
      sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voice of M. Fouquet,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, who was standing close to the
      queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then M. d&rsquo;Herblay cannot be far off,&rdquo; added Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he then saw what he little thought to have beheld so near to him. All
      eyes were turned towards the door at which M. Fouquet was expected to
      enter; but it was not M. Fouquet who entered. A terrible cry resounded
      from all corners of the chamber, a painful cry uttered by the king and all
      present. It is given to but few men, even those whose destiny contains the
      strangest elements, and accidents the most wonderful, to contemplate such
      a spectacle similar to that which presented itself in the royal chamber at
      that moment. The half-closed shutters only admitted the entrance of an
      uncertain light passing through thick violet velvet curtains lined with
      silk. In this soft shade, the eyes were by degrees dilated, and every one
      present saw others rather with imagination than with actual sight. There
      could not, however, escape, in these circumstances, one of the surrounding
      details; and the new object which presented itself appeared as luminous as
      though it shone out in full sunlight. So it happened with Louis XIV., when
      he showed himself, pale and frowning, in the doorway of the secret stairs.
      The face of Fouquet appeared behind him, stamped with sorrow and
      determination. The queen-mother, who perceived Louis XIV., and who held
      the hand of Philippe, uttered a cry of which we have spoken, as if she
      beheld a phantom. Monsieur was bewildered, and kept turning his head in
      astonishment from one to the other. Madame made a step forward, thinking
      she was looking at the form of her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror.
      And, in fact, the illusion was possible. The two princes, both pale as
      death&mdash;for we renounce the hope of being able to describe the fearful
      state of Philippe&mdash;trembling, clenching their hands convulsively,
      measured each other with looks, and darted their glances, sharp as
      poniards, at each other. Silent, panting, bending forward, they appeared
      as if about to spring upon an enemy. The unheard-of resemblance of
      countenance, gesture, shape, height, even to the resemblance of costume,
      produced by chance&mdash;for Louis XIV. had been to the Louvre and put on
      a violet-colored dress&mdash;the perfect analogy of the two princes,
      completed the consternation of Anne of Austria. And yet she did not at
      once guess the truth. There are misfortunes in life so truly dreadful that
      no one will at first accept them; people rather believe in the
      supernatural and the impossible. Louis had not reckoned on these
      obstacles. He expected that he had only to appear to be acknowledged. A
      living sun, he could not endure the suspicion of equality with any one. He
      did not admit that every torch should not become darkness at the instant
      he shone out with his conquering ray. At the aspect of Philippe, then, he
      was perhaps more terrified than any one round him, and his silence, his
      immobility were, this time, a concentration and a calm which precede the
      violent explosions of concentrated passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fouquet! who shall paint his emotion and stupor in presence of this
      living portrait of his master! Fouquet thought Aramis was right, that this
      newly-arrived was a king as pure in his race as the other, and that, for
      having repudiated all participation in this <i>coup d&rsquo;etat</i>, so
      skillfully got up by the General of the Jesuits, he must be a mad
      enthusiast, unworthy of ever dipping his hands in political grand strategy
      work. And then it was the blood of Louis XIII. which Fouquet was
      sacrificing to the blood of Louis XIII.; it was to a selfish ambition he
      was sacrificing a noble ambition; to the right of keeping he sacrificed
      the right of having. The whole extent of his fault was revealed to him at
      simple sight of the pretender. All that passed in the mind of Fouquet was
      lost upon the persons present. He had five minutes to focus meditation on
      this point of conscience; five minutes, that is to say five ages, during
      which the two kings and their family scarcely found energy to breathe
      after so terrible a shock. D&rsquo;Artagnan, leaning against the wall, in front
      of Fouquet, with his hand to his brow, asked himself the cause of such a
      wonderful prodigy. He could not have said at once why he doubted, but he
      knew assuredly that he had reason to doubt, and that in this meeting of
      the two Louis XIV.s lay all the doubt and difficulty that during late days
      had rendered the conduct of Aramis so suspicious to the musketeer. These
      ideas were, however, enveloped in a haze, a veil of mystery. The actors in
      this assembly seemed to swim in the vapors of a confused waking. Suddenly
      Louis XIV., more impatient and more accustomed to command, ran to one of
      the shutters, which he opened, tearing the curtains in his eagerness. A
      flood of living light entered the chamber, and made Philippe draw back to
      the alcove. Louis seized upon this movement with eagerness, and addressing
      himself to the queen:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you not acknowledge your son, since every one
      here has forgotten his king!&rdquo; Anne of Austria started, and raised her arms
      towards Heaven, without being able to articulate a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; said Philippe, with a calm voice, &ldquo;do you not acknowledge
      your son?&rdquo; And this time, in his turn, Louis drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Anne of Austria, struck suddenly in head and heart with fell
      remorse, she lost her equilibrium. No one aiding her, for all were
      petrified, she sank back in her fauteuil, breathing a weak, trembling
      sigh. Louis could not endure the spectacle and the affront. He bounded
      towards D&rsquo;Artagnan, over whose brain a vertigo was stealing and who
      staggered as he caught at the door for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A moi! mousquetaire!</i>&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Look us in the face and say which
      is the paler, he or I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This cry roused D&rsquo;Artagnan, and stirred in his heart the fibers of
      obedience. He shook his head, and, without more hesitation, he walked
      straight up to Philippe, on whose shoulder he laid his hand, saying,
      &ldquo;Monsieur, you are my prisoner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philippe did not raise his eyes towards Heaven, nor stir from the spot,
      where he seemed nailed to the floor, his eye intently fixed upon the king
      his brother. He reproached him with a sublime silence for all misfortunes
      past, all tortures to come. Against this language of the soul the king
      felt he had no power; he cast down his eyes, dragging away precipitately
      his brother and sister, forgetting his mother, sitting motionless within
      three paces of the son whom she left a second time to be condemned to
      death. Philippe approached Anne of Austria, and said to her, in a soft and
      nobly agitated voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were not your son, I should curse you, my mother, for having
      rendered me so unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan felt a shudder pass through the marrow of his bones. He bowed
      respectfully to the young prince, and said as he bent, &ldquo;Excuse me,
      monseigneur, I am but a soldier, and my oaths are his who has just left
      the chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan.... What has become of M. d&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay is in safety, monseigneur,&rdquo; said a voice behind them; &ldquo;and
      no one, while I live and am free, shall cause a hair to fall from his
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Fouquet!&rdquo; said the prince, smiling sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Fouquet, kneeling, &ldquo;but he who is just gone
      out from hence was my guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are,&rdquo; murmured Philippe, with a sigh, &ldquo;brave friends and good
      hearts. They make me regret the world. On, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, I follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the moment the captain of the musketeers was about to leave the room
      with his prisoner, Colbert appeared, and, after remitting an order from
      the king to D&rsquo;Artagnan, retired. D&rsquo;Artagnan read the paper, and then
      crushed it in his hand with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippe read the following words, hastily traced by the hand of the king:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan will conduct the prisoner to the Ile Sainte-Marguerite. He
      will cover his face with an iron vizor, which the prisoner shall never
      raise except at peril of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just,&rdquo; said Philippe, with resignation; &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis was right,&rdquo; said Fouquet, in a low voice, to the musketeer, &ldquo;this
      one is every whit as much a king as the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More so!&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;He wanted only you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XXV. In Which Porthos Thinks He Is Pursuing a Duchy.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aramis and Porthos, having profited by the time granted them by Fouquet,
      did honor to the French cavalry by their speed. Porthos did not clearly
      understand on what kind of mission he was forced to display so much
      velocity; but as he saw Aramis spurring on furiously, he, Porthos, spurred
      on in the same way. They had soon, in this manner, placed twelve leagues
      between them and Vaux; they were then obliged to change horses, and
      organize a sort of post arrangement. It was during a relay that Porthos
      ventured to interrogate Aramis discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;know only that our fortune depends on our
      speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if Porthos had still been the musketeer, without a sou or a <i>maille</i>
      of 1626, he pushed forward. That magic word &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; always means
      something in the human ear. It means <i>enough</i> for those who have
      nothing; it means <i>too much</i> for those who have enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be made a duke!&rdquo; said Porthos, aloud. He was speaking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is possible,&rdquo; replied Aramis, smiling after his own fashion, as
      Porthos&rsquo;s horse passed him. Aramis felt, notwithstanding, as though his
      brain were on fire; the activity of the body had not yet succeeded in
      subduing that of the mind. All there is of raging passion, mental
      toothache or mortal threat, raged, gnawed and grumbled in the thoughts of
      the unhappy prelate. His countenance exhibited visible traces of this rude
      combat. Free on the highway to abandon himself to every impression of the
      moment, Aramis did not fail to swear at every start of his horse, at every
      inequality in the road. Pale, at times inundated with boiling sweats, then
      again dry and icy, he flogged his horses till the blood streamed from
      their sides. Porthos, whose dominant fault was not sensibility, groaned at
      this. Thus traveled they on for eight long hours, and then arrived at
      Orleans. It was four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Aramis, on observing this,
      judged that nothing showed pursuit to be a possibility. It would be
      without example that a troop capable of taking him and Porthos should be
      furnished with relays sufficient to perform forty leagues in eight hours.
      Thus, admitting pursuit, which was not at all manifest, the fugitives were
      five hours in advance of their pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis thought that there might be no imprudence in taking a little rest,
      but that to continue would make the matter more certain. Twenty leagues
      more, performed with the same rapidity, twenty more leagues devoured, and
      no one, not even D&rsquo;Artagnan, could overtake the enemies of the king.
      Aramis felt obliged, therefore, to inflict upon Porthos the pain of
      mounting on horseback again. They rode on till seven o&rsquo;clock in the
      evening, and had only one post more between them and Blois. But here a
      diabolical accident alarmed Aramis greatly. There were no horses at the
      post. The prelate asked himself by what infernal machination his enemies
      had succeeded in depriving him of the means of going further,&mdash;he who
      never recognized chance as a deity, who found a cause for every accident,
      preferred believing that the refusal of the postmaster, at such an hour,
      in such a country, was the consequence of an order emanating from above:
      an order given with a view of stopping short the king-maker in the midst
      of his flight. But at the moment he was about to fly into a passion, so as
      to procure either a horse or an explanation, he was struck with the
      recollection that the Comte de la Fere lived in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not traveling,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I do not want horses for a whole stage.
      Find me two horses to go and pay a visit to a nobleman of my acquaintance
      who resides near this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nobleman?&rdquo; asked the postmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Comte de la Fere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the postmaster, uncovering with respect, &ldquo;a very worthy
      nobleman. But, whatever may be my desire to make myself agreeable to him,
      I cannot furnish you with horses, for all mine are engaged by M. le Duc de
      Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Aramis, much disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; continued the postmaster, &ldquo;if you will put up with a little
      carriage I have, I will harness an old blind horse who has still his legs
      left, and peradventure will draw you to the house of M. le Comte de la
      Fere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worth a louis,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, such a ride is worth no more than a crown; that is what M.
      Grimaud, the comte&rsquo;s intendant, always pays me when he makes use of that
      carriage; and I should not wish the Comte de la Fere to have to reproach
      me with having imposed on one of his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;particularly as regards disobliging the
      Comte de la Fere; only I think I have a right to give you a louis for your
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! doubtless,&rdquo; replied the postmaster with delight. And he himself
      harnessed the ancient horse to the creaking carriage. In the meantime
      Porthos was curious to behold. He imagined he had discovered a clew to the
      secret, and he felt pleased, because a visit to Athos, in the first place,
      promised him much satisfaction, and, in the next, gave him the hope of
      finding at the same time a good bed and good supper. The master, having
      got the carriage ready, ordered one of his men to drive the strangers to
      La Fere. Porthos took his seat by the side of Aramis, whispering in his
      ear, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;and what do you understand, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going, on the part of the king, to make some great proposal to
      Athos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need tell me nothing about it,&rdquo; added the worthy Porthos, endeavoring
      to reseat himself so as to avoid the jolting, &ldquo;you need tell me nothing, I
      shall guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! do, my friend; guess away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at Athos&rsquo;s dwelling about nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening,
      favored by a splendid moon. This cheerful light rejoiced Porthos beyond
      expression; but Aramis appeared annoyed by it in an equal degree. He could
      not help showing something of this to Porthos, who replied&mdash;&ldquo;Ay! ay!
      I guess how it is! the mission is a secret one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were his last words in the carriage. The driver interrupted him by
      saying, &ldquo;Gentlemen, we have arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos and his companion alighted before the gate of the little chateau,
      where we are about to meet again our old acquaintances Athos and
      Bragelonne, the latter of whom had disappeared since the discovery of the
      infidelity of La Valliere. If there be one saying truer than another, it
      is this: great griefs contain within themselves the germ of consolation.
      This painful wound, inflicted upon Raoul, had drawn him nearer to his
      father again; and God knows how sweet were the consolations which flowed
      from the eloquent mouth and generous heart of Athos. The wound was not
      cicatrized, but Athos, by dint of conversing with his son and mixing a
      little more of his life with that of the young man, had brought him to
      understand that this pang of a first infidelity is necessary to every
      human existence; and that no one has loved without encountering it. Raoul
      listened, again and again, but never understood. Nothing replaces in the
      deeply afflicted heart the remembrance and thought of the beloved object.
      Raoul then replied to the reasoning of his father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, all that you tell me is true; I believe that no one has
      suffered in the affections of the heart so much as you have; but you are a
      man too great by reason of intelligence, and too severely tried by adverse
      fortune not to allow for the weakness of the soldier who suffers for the
      first time. I am paying a tribute that will not be paid a second time;
      permit me to plunge myself so deeply in my grief that I may forget myself
      in it, that I may drown even my reason in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul! Raoul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, monsieur. Never shall I accustom myself to the idea that Louise,
      the chastest and most innocent of women, has been able to so basely
      deceive a man so honest and so true a lover as myself. Never can I
      persuade myself that I see that sweet and noble mask change into a
      hypocritical lascivious face. Louise lost! Louise infamous! Ah!
      monseigneur, that idea is much more cruel to me than Raoul abandoned&mdash;Raoul
      unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos then employed the heroic remedy. He defended Louise against Raoul,
      and justified her perfidy by her love. &ldquo;A woman who would have yielded to
      a king because he is a king,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would deserve to be styled
      infamous; but Louise loves Louis. Young, both, they have forgotten, he his
      rank, she her vows. Love absolves everything, Raoul. The two young people
      love each other with sincerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when he had dealt this severe poniard-thrust, Athos, with a sigh, saw
      Raoul bound away beneath the rankling wound, and fly to the thickest
      recesses of the wood, or the solitude of his chamber, whence, an hour
      after, he would return, pale, trembling, but subdued. Then, coming up to
      Athos with a smile, he would kiss his hand, like the dog who, having been
      beaten, caresses a respected master, to redeem his fault. Raoul redeemed
      nothing but his weakness, and only confessed his grief. Thus passed away
      the days that followed that scene in which Athos had so violently shaken
      the indomitable pride of the king. Never, when conversing with his son,
      did he make any allusion to that scene; never did he give him the details
      of that vigorous lecture, which might, perhaps, have consoled the young
      man, by showing him his rival humbled. Athos did not wish that the
      offended lover should forget the respect due to his king. And when
      Bragelonne, ardent, angry, and melancholy, spoke with contempt of royal
      words, of the equivocal faith which certain madmen draw from promises that
      emanate from thrones, when, passing over two centuries, with that rapidity
      of a bird that traverses a narrow strait to go from one continent to the
      other, Raoul ventured to predict the time in which kings would be esteemed
      as less than other men, Athos said to him, in his serene, persuasive
      voice, &ldquo;You are right, Raoul; all that you say will happen; kings will
      lose their privileges, as stars which have survived their aeons lose their
      splendor. But when that moment comes, Raoul, we shall be dead. And
      remember well what I say to you. In this world, all, men, women, and
      kings, must live for the present. We can only live for the future for
      God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the manner in which Athos and Raoul were, as usual, conversing,
      and walking backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the park,
      when the bell which served to announce to the comte either the hour of
      dinner or the arrival of a visitor, was rung; and, without attaching any
      importance to it, he turned towards the house with his son; and at the end
      of the alley they found themselves in the presence of Aramis and Porthos.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI. The Last Adieux.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Raoul uttered a cry, and affectionately embraced Porthos. Aramis and Athos
      embraced like old men; and this embrace itself being a question for
      Aramis, he immediately said, &ldquo;My friend, we have not long to remain with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only time to tell you of my good fortune,&rdquo; interrupted Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos looked silently at Aramis, whose somber air had already appeared to
      him very little in harmony with the good news Porthos hinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good fortune that has happened to you? Let us hear it,&rdquo; said
      Raoul, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has made me a duke,&rdquo; said the worthy Porthos, with an air of
      mystery, in the ear of the young man, &ldquo;a duke by <i>brevet</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the <i>asides</i> of Porthos were always loud enough to be heard by
      everybody. His murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring. Athos
      heard him, and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis start. The latter
      took Athos by the arm, and, after having asked Porthos&rsquo;s permission to say
      a word to his friend in private, &ldquo;My dear Athos,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you see me
      overwhelmed with grief and trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With grief and trouble, my dear friend?&rdquo; cried the comte; &ldquo;oh, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two words. I have conspired against the king; that conspiracy has
      failed, and, at this moment, I am doubtless pursued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pursued!&mdash;a conspiracy! Eh! my friend, what do you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The saddest truth. I am entirely ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but Porthos&mdash;this title of duke&mdash;what does all that
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the subject of my severest pain; that is the deepest of my
      wounds. I have, believing in infallible success, drawn Porthos into my
      conspiracy. He threw himself into it, as you know he would do, with all
      his strength, without knowing what he was about; and now he is as much
      compromised as myself&mdash;as completely ruined as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; And Athos turned towards Porthos, who was smiling
      complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must make you acquainted with the whole. Listen to me,&rdquo; continued
      Aramis; and he related the history as we know it. Athos, during the
      recital, several times felt the sweat break from his forehead. &ldquo;It was a
      great idea,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but a great error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which I am punished, Athos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, I will not tell you my entire thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it, nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A capital crime; I know it is. <i>Lese majeste</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos! poor Porthos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you advise me to do? Success, as I have told you, was
      certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet is an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I a fool for having so ill-judged him,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Oh, the wisdom
      of man! Oh, millstone that grinds the world! and which is one day stopped
      by a grain of sand which has fallen, no one knows how, between its
      wheels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say by a diamond, Aramis. But the thing is done. How do you think of
      acting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am taking away Porthos. The king will never believe that that worthy
      man has acted innocently. He never can believe that Porthos has thought he
      was serving the king, whilst acting as he has done. His head would pay my
      fault. It shall not, must not, be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are taking him away, whither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Belle-Isle, at first. That is an impregnable place of refuge. Then, I
      have the sea, and a vessel to pass over into England, where I have many
      relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or else in Spain, where I have still more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, our excellent Porthos! you ruin him, for the king will confiscate
      all his property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is provided for. I know how, when once in Spain, to reconcile myself
      with Louis XIV., and restore Porthos to favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have credit, seemingly, Aramis!&rdquo; said Athos, with a discreet air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much; and at the service of my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while we are on this head,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;you also are a malcontent;
      you also, Raoul, have griefs to lay to the king. Follow our example; pass
      over into Belle-Isle. Then we shall see, I guarantee upon my honor, that
      in a month there will be war between France and Spain on the subject of
      this son of Louis XIII., who is an Infante likewise, and whom France
      detains inhumanly. Now, as Louis XIV. would have no inclination for a war
      on that subject, I will answer for an arrangement, the result of which
      must bring greatness to Porthos and to me, and a duchy in France to you,
      who are already a grandee of Spain. Will you join us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with; it
      is a pride natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal
      races. Doing what you propose, I should become the obliged of the king; I
      should certainly be the gainer on that ground, but I should be a loser in
      my conscience.&mdash;No, thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give me two things, Athos,&mdash;your absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I give it you if you really wished to avenge the weak and oppressed
      against the oppressor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is sufficient for me,&rdquo; said Aramis, with a blush which was lost in
      the obscurity of the night. &ldquo;And now, give me your two best horses to gain
      the second post, as I have been refused any under the pretext of the Duc
      de Beaufort being traveling in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have the two best horses, Aramis; and again I recommend poor
      Porthos strongly to your care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have no fear on that score. One word more: do you think I am
      maneuvering for him as I ought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evil being committed, yes; for the king would not pardon him, and you
      have, whatever may be said, always a supporter in M. Fouquet, who will not
      abandon you, he being himself compromised, notwithstanding his heroic
      action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. And that is why, instead of gaining the sea at once, which
      would proclaim my fear and guilt, that is why I remain upon French ground.
      But Belle-Isle will be for me whatever ground I wish it to be, English,
      Spanish, or Roman; all will depend, with me, on the standard I shall think
      proper to unfurl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I who fortified Belle-Isle; and, so long as I defend it, nobody
      can take Belle-Isle from me. And then, as you have said just now, M.
      Fouquet is there. Belle-Isle will not be attacked without the signature of
      M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. Nevertheless, be prudent. The king is both cunning and
      strong.&rdquo; Aramis smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I again recommend Porthos to you,&rdquo; repeated the count, with a sort of
      cold persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever becomes of me, count,&rdquo; replied Aramis, in the same tone, &ldquo;our
      brother Porthos will fare as I do&mdash;or <i>better</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis, and turned to embrace
      Porthos with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born lucky, was I not?&rdquo; murmured the latter, transported with
      happiness, as he folded his cloak round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul had gone out to give orders for the saddling of the horses. The
      group was already divided. Athos saw his two friends on the point of
      departure, and something like a mist passed before his eyes and weighed
      upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;whence comes the inclination I feel to
      embrace Porthos once more?&rdquo; At that moment Porthos turned round, and he
      came towards his old friend with open arms. This last endearment was
      tender as in youth, as in times when hearts were warm&mdash;life happy.
      And then Porthos mounted his horse. Aramis came back once more to throw
      his arms round the neck of Athos. The latter watched them along the
      high-road, elongated by the shade, in their white cloaks. Like phantoms
      they seemed to enlarge on their departure from the earth, and it was not
      in the mist, but in the declivity of the ground that they disappeared. At
      the end of the perspective, both seemed to have given a spring with their
      feet, which made them vanish as if evaporated into cloud-land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Athos, with a very heavy heart, returned towards the house, saying to
      Bragelonne, &ldquo;Raoul, I don&rsquo;t know what it is that has just told me that I
      have seen those two for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not astonish me, monsieur, that you should have such a thought,&rdquo;
       replied the young man, &ldquo;for I have at this moment the same, and think also
      that I shall never see Messieurs du Vallon and d&rsquo;Herblay again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you,&rdquo; replied the count, &ldquo;you speak like a man rendered sad by a
      different cause; you see everything in black; you are young, and if you
      chance never to see those old friends again, it will because they no
      longer exist in the world in which you have yet many years to pass. But I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul shook his head sadly, and leaned upon the shoulder of the count,
      without either of them finding another word in their hearts, which were
      ready to overflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once a noise of horses and voices, from the extremity of the road
      to Blois, attracted their attention that way. Flambeaux-bearers shook
      their torches merrily among the trees of their route, and turned round,
      from time to time, to avoid distancing the horsemen who followed them.
      These flames, this noise, this dust of a dozen richly caparisoned horses,
      formed a strange contrast in the middle of the night with the melancholy
      and almost funereal disappearance of the two shadows of Aramis and
      Porthos. Athos went towards the house; but he had hardly reached the
      parterre, when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze; all the flambeaux
      stopped and appeared to enflame the road. A cry was heard of &ldquo;M. le Duc de
      Beaufort&rdquo;&mdash;and Athos sprang towards the door of his house. But the
      duke had already alighted from his horse, and was looking around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! good evening, dear count,&rdquo; said the prince, with that frank
      cordiality which won him so many hearts. &ldquo;Is it too late for a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear prince, come in!&rdquo; said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, M. de Beaufort leaning on the arm of Athos, they entered the house,
      followed by Raoul, who walked respectfully and modestly among the officers
      of the prince, with several of whom he was acquainted.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVII. Monsieur de Beaufort.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The prince turned round at the moment when Raoul, in order to leave him
      alone with Athos, was shutting the door, and preparing to go with the
      other officers into an adjoining apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the young man I have heard M. le Prince speak so highly of?&rdquo;
       asked M. de Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is quite the soldier; let him stay, count, we cannot spare him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain, Raoul, since monseigneur permits it,&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> he is tall and handsome!&rdquo; continued the duke. &ldquo;Will you
      give him to me, monseigneur, if I ask him of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to understand you, monseigneur?&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I call upon you to bid you farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in good truth. Have you no idea of what I am about to become?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose, what you have always been, monseigneur,&mdash;a valiant
      prince, and an excellent gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to become an African prince,&mdash;a Bedouin gentleman. The
      king is sending me to make conquests among the Arabs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this you tell me, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange, is it not? I, the Parisian <i>par essence</i>, I who have
      reigned in the faubourgs, and have been called King of the Halles,&mdash;I
      am going to pass from the Place Maubert to the minarets of Gigelli; from a
      Frondeur I am becoming an adventurer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monseigneur, if you did not yourself tell me that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be credible, would it? Believe me, nevertheless, and we have
      but to bid each other farewell. This is what comes of getting into favor
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You smile. Ah, my dear count, do you know why I have accepted this
      enterprise, can you guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because your highness loves glory above&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no; there is no glory in firing muskets at savages. I see no glory in
      that, for my part, and it is more probable that I shall there meet with
      something else. But I have wished, and still wish earnestly, my dear
      count, that my life should have that last <i>facet</i>, after all the
      whimsical exhibitions I have seen myself make during fifty years. For, in
      short, you must admit that it is sufficiently strange to be born the
      grandson of a king, to have made war against kings, to have been reckoned
      among the powers of the age, to have maintained my rank, to feel Henry IV.
      within me, to be great admiral of France&mdash;and then to go and get
      killed at Gigelli, among all those Turks, Saracens, and Moors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, you harp with strange persistence on that theme,&rdquo; said
      Athos, in an agitated voice. &ldquo;How can you suppose that so brilliant a
      destiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you believe, upright and simple as you are, that if I go into
      Africa for this ridiculous motive, I will not endeavor to come out of it
      without ridicule? Shall I not give the world cause to speak of me? And to
      be spoken of, nowadays, when there are Monsieur le Prince, M. de Turenne,
      and many others, my contemporaries, I, admiral of France, grandson of
      Henry IV., king of Paris, have I anything left but to get myself killed?
      <i>Cordieu!</i> I will be talked of, I tell you; I shall be killed whether
      or not; if not there, somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, monseigneur, this is mere exaggeration; and hitherto you have shown
      nothing exaggerated save in bravery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Peste!</i> my dear friend, there is bravery in facing scurvy,
      dysentery, locusts, poisoned arrows, as my ancestor St. Louis did. Do you
      know those fellows still use poisoned arrows? And then, you know me of
      old, I fancy, and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing, I
      perform it in grim earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you made up your mind to escape from Vincennes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but you aided me in that, my master; and, <i>a propos</i>, I turn
      this way and that, without seeing my old friend, M. Vaugrimaud. How is
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Vaugrimaud is still your highness&rsquo;s most respectful servant,&rdquo; said
      Athos, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a hundred pistoles here for him, which I bring as a legacy. My
      will is made, count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monseigneur! monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you may understand that if Grimaud&rsquo;s name were to appear in my will&mdash;&rdquo;
       The duke began to laugh; then addressing Raoul, who, from the commencement
      of this conversation, had sunk into a profound reverie, &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;I know there is to be found here a certain De Vouvray wine, and I
      believe&mdash;&rdquo; Raoul left the room precipitately to order the wine. In
      the meantime M. de Beaufort took the hand of Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean to do with him?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at present, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, I know; since the passion of the king for La Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all true, then, is it? I think I know her, that little La
      Valliere. She is not particularly handsome, if I remember right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know whom she reminds me of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she remind your highness of any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She reminds me of a very agreeable girl, whose mother lived in the
      Halles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; said Athos, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the good old times,&rdquo; added M. de Beaufort. &ldquo;Yes, La Valliere reminds
      me of that girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who had a son, had she not?&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"
       id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she had,&rdquo; replied the duke, with careless <i>naivete</i> and a
      complaisant forgetfulness, of which no words could translate the tone and
      the vocal expression. &ldquo;Now, here is poor Raoul, who is your son, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is my son, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the poor lad has been cut out by the king, and he frets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still better, monseigneur, he abstains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to let the boy rust in idleness; it is a mistake. Come,
      give him to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wish is to keep him at home, monseigneur. I have no longer anything in
      the world but him, and as long as he likes to remain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied the duke. &ldquo;I could, nevertheless, have soon put
      matters to rights again. I assure you, I think he has in him the stuff of
      which marechals of France are made; I have seen more than one produced
      from less likely rough material.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very possible, monseigneur; but it is the king who makes
      marechals of France, and Raoul will never accept anything of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul interrupted this conversation by his return. He preceded Grimaud,
      whose still steady hands carried the plateau with one glass and a bottle
      of the duke&rsquo;s favorite wine. On seeing his old <i>protege</i>, the duke
      uttered an exclamation of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grimaud! Good evening, Grimaud!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;how goes it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant bowed profoundly, as much gratified as his noble interlocutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two old friends!&rdquo; said the duke, shaking honest Grimaud&rsquo;s shoulder after
      a vigorous fashion; which was followed by another still more profound and
      delighted bow from Grimaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is this, count, only one glass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not think of drinking with your highness, unless your highness
      permitted me,&rdquo; replied Athos, with noble humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cordieu!</i> you were right to bring only one glass, we will both
      drink out of it, like two brothers in arms. Begin, count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me the honor,&rdquo; said Athos, gently putting back the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a charming friend,&rdquo; replied the Duc de Beaufort, who drank, and
      passed the goblet to his companion. &ldquo;But that is not all,&rdquo; continued he,
      &ldquo;I am still thirsty, and I wish to do honor to this handsome young man who
      stands here. I carry good luck with me, vicomte,&rdquo; said he to Raoul; &ldquo;wish
      for something while drinking out of my glass, and may the black plague
      grab me if what you wish does not come to pass!&rdquo; He held the goblet to
      Raoul, who hastily moistened his lips, and replied with the same
      promptitude:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wished for something, monseigneur.&rdquo; His eyes sparkled with a
      gloomy fire, and the blood mounted to his cheeks; he terrified Athos, if
      only with his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you wished for?&rdquo; replied the duke, sinking back into his
      fauteuil, whilst with one hand he returned the bottle to Grimaud, and with
      the other gave him a purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise me, monseigneur, to grant me what I wish for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> That is agreed upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished, monsieur le duc, to go with you to Gigelli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos became pale, and was unable to conceal his agitation. The duke
      looked at his friend, as if desirous to assist him to parry this
      unexpected blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is difficult, my dear vicomte, very difficult,&rdquo; added he, in a lower
      tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, monseigneur, I have been indiscreet,&rdquo; replied Raoul, in a firm
      voice; &ldquo;but as you yourself invited me to wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To wish to leave me?&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur&mdash;can you imagine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>mordieu!</i>&rdquo; cried the duke, &ldquo;the young vicomte is right! What
      can he do here? He will go moldy with grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul blushed, and the excitable prince continued: &ldquo;War is a distraction:
      we gain everything by it; we can only lose one thing by it&mdash;life&mdash;then
      so much the worse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, memory,&rdquo; said Raoul, eagerly; &ldquo;and that is to say, so
      much the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repented of having spoken so warmly when he saw Athos rise and open the
      window; which was, doubtless, to conceal his emotion. Raoul sprang towards
      the comte, but the latter had already overcome his emotion, and turned to
      the lights with a serene and impassible countenance. &ldquo;Well, come,&rdquo; said
      the duke, &ldquo;let us see! Shall he go, or shall he not? If he goes, comte, he
      shall be my aide-de-camp, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; cried Raoul, bending his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; cried Athos, taking the hand of the duke; &ldquo;Raoul shall do
      just as he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, monsieur, just as you like,&rdquo; interrupted the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Par la corbleu!</i>&rdquo; said the prince in his turn, &ldquo;it is neither the
      comte nor the vicomte that shall have his way, it is I. I will take him
      away. The marine offers a superb fortune, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul smiled again so sadly, that this time Athos felt his heart
      penetrated by it, and replied to him by a severe look. Raoul comprehended
      it all; he recovered his calmness, and was so guarded, that not another
      word escaped him. The duke at length rose, on observing the advanced hour,
      and said, with animation, &ldquo;I am in great haste, but if I am told I have
      lost time in talking with a friend, I will reply I have gained&mdash;on
      the balance&mdash;a most excellent recruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, monsieur le duc,&rdquo; interrupted Raoul, &ldquo;do not tell the king so,
      for it is not the king I wish to serve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! my friend, whom, then, will you serve? The times are past when you
      might have said, &lsquo;I belong to M. de Beaufort.&rsquo; No, nowadays, we all belong
      to the king, great or small. Therefore, if you serve on board my vessels,
      there can be nothing equivocal about it, my dear vicomte; it will be the
      king you will serve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos waited with a kind of impatient joy for the reply about to be made
      to this embarrassing question by Raoul, the intractable enemy of the king,
      his rival. The father hoped that the obstacle would overcome the desire.
      He was thankful to M. de Beaufort, whose lightness or generous reflection
      had thrown an impediment in the way of the departure of a son, now his
      only joy. But Raoul, still firm and tranquil, replied: &ldquo;Monsieur le duc,
      the objection you make I have already considered in my mind. I will serve
      on board your vessels, because you do me the honor to take me with you;
      but I shall there serve a more powerful master than the king: I shall
      serve God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! how so?&rdquo; said the duke and Athos together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intention is to make profession, and become a knight of Malta,&rdquo; added
      Bragelonne, letting fall, one by one, words more icy than the drops which
      fall from the bare trees after the tempests of winter. <a
      href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this blow Athos staggered and the prince himself was moved. Grimaud
      uttered a heavy groan, and let fall the bottle, which was broken without
      anybody paying attention. M. de Beaufort looked the young man in the face,
      and read plainly, though his eyes were cast down, the fire of resolution
      before which everything must give way. As to Athos, he was too well
      acquainted with that tender, but inflexible soul; he could not hope to
      make it deviate from the fatal road it had just chosen. He could only
      press the hand the duke held out to him. &ldquo;Comte, I shall set off in two
      days for Toulon,&rdquo; said M. de Beaufort. &ldquo;Will you meet me at Paris, in
      order that I may know your determination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have the honor of thanking you there, <i>mon prince</i>, for all
      your kindness,&rdquo; replied the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be sure to bring the vicomte with you, whether he follows me or does
      not follow me,&rdquo; added the duke; &ldquo;he has my word, and I only ask yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thrown a little balm upon the wound of the paternal heart, he
      pulled the ear of Grimaud, whose eyes sparkled more than usual, and
      regained his escort in the parterre. The horses, rested and refreshed, set
      off with spirit through the lovely night, and soon placed a considerable
      distance between their master and the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos and Bragelonne were again face to face. Eleven o&rsquo;clock was striking.
      The father and son preserved a profound silence towards each other, where
      an intelligent observer would have expected cries and tears. But these two
      men were of such a nature that all emotion following their final
      resolutions plunged itself so deep into their hearts that it was lost
      forever. They passed, then, silently and almost breathlessly, the hour
      that preceded midnight. The clock, by striking, alone pointed out to them
      how many minutes had lasted the painful journey made by their souls in the
      immensity of their remembrances of the past and fear of the future. Athos
      rose first, saying, &ldquo;it is late, then.... Till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul rose, and in his turn embraced his father. The latter held him
      clasped to his breast, and said, in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;In two days, you
      will have left me, my son&mdash;left me forever, Raoul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;I had formed a determination, that of
      piercing my heart with my sword; but you would have thought that cowardly.
      I have renounced that determination, and <i>therefore</i> we must part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave me desolate by going, Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me again, monsieur, I implore you. If I do not go, I shall die
      here of grief and love. I know how long a time I have to live thus. Send
      me away quickly, monsieur, or you will see me basely die before your eyes&mdash;in
      your house&mdash;this is stronger than my will&mdash;stronger than my
      strength&mdash;you may plainly see that within one month I have lived
      thirty years, and that I approach the end of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Athos, coldly, &ldquo;you go with the intention of getting killed
      in Africa? Oh, tell me! do not lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul grew deadly pale, and remained silent for two seconds, which were to
      his father two hours of agony. Then, all at once: &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
      have promised to devote myself to God. In exchange for the sacrifice I
      make of my youth and liberty, I will only ask of Him one thing, and that
      is, to preserve me for you, because you are the only tie which attaches me
      to this world. God alone can give me the strength not to forget that I owe
      you everything, and that nothing ought to stand in my esteem before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos embraced his son tenderly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just replied to me on the word of honor of an honest man; in two
      days we shall be with M. de Beaufort at Paris, and you will then do what
      will be proper for you to do. You are free, Raoul; adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he slowly gained his bedroom. Raoul went down into the garden, and
      passed the night in the alley of limes.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVIII. Preparations for Departure.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Athos lost no more time in combating this immutable resolution. He gave
      all his attention to preparing, during the two days the duke had granted
      him, the proper appointments for Raoul. This labor chiefly concerned
      Grimaud, who immediately applied himself to it with the good-will and
      intelligence we know he possessed. Athos gave this worthy servant orders
      to take the route to Paris when the equipments should be ready; and, not
      to expose himself to the danger of keeping the duke waiting, or delaying
      Raoul, so that the duke should perceive his absence, he himself, the day
      after the visit of M. de Beaufort, set off for Paris with his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the poor young man it was an emotion easily to be understood, thus to
      return to Paris amongst all the people who had known and loved him. Every
      face recalled a pang to him who had suffered so much; to him who had loved
      so much, some circumstance of his unhappy love. Raoul, on approaching
      Paris, felt as if he were dying. Once in Paris, he really existed no
      longer. When he reached Guiche&rsquo;s residence, he was informed that Guiche
      was with Monsieur. Raoul took the road to the Luxembourg, and when
      arrived, without suspecting that he was going to the place where La
      Valliere had lived, he heard so much music and respired so many perfumes,
      he heard so much joyous laughter, and saw so many dancing shadows, that if
      it had not been for a charitable woman, who perceived him so dejected and
      pale beneath a doorway, he would have remained there a few minutes, and
      then would have gone away, never to return. But, as we have said, in the
      first ante-chamber he had stopped, solely for the sake of not mixing
      himself with all those happy beings he felt were moving around him in the
      adjacent salons. And as one of Monsieur&rsquo;s servants, recognizing him, had
      asked him if he wished to see Monsieur or Madame, Raoul had scarcely
      answered him, but had sunk down upon a bench near the velvet doorway,
      looking at a clock, which had stopped for nearly an hour. The servant had
      passed on, and another, better acquainted with him, had come up, and
      interrogated Raoul whether he should inform M. de Guiche of his being
      there. This name did not even arouse the recollections of Raoul. The
      persistent servant went on to relate that De Guiche had just invented a
      new game of lottery, and was teaching it to the ladies. Raoul, opening his
      large eyes, like the absent man in Theophrastus, made no answer, but his
      sadness increased two shades. With his head hanging down, his limbs
      relaxed, his mouth half open for the escape of his sighs, Raoul remained,
      thus forgotten, in the ante-chamber, when all at once a lady&rsquo;s robe
      passed, rubbing against the doors of a side salon, which opened on the
      gallery. A lady, young, pretty, and gay, scolding an officer of the
      household, entered by that way, and expressed herself with much vivacity.
      The officer replied in calm but firm sentences; it was rather a little
      love pet than a quarrel of courtiers, and was terminated by a kiss on the
      fingers of the lady. Suddenly, on perceiving Raoul, the lady became
      silent, and pushing away the officer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your escape, Malicorne,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I did not think there was any
      one here. I shall curse you, if they have either heard or seen us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne hastened away. The young lady advanced behind Raoul, and
      stretching her joyous face over him as he lay:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is a gallant man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and no doubt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She here interrupted herself by uttering a cry. &ldquo;Raoul!&rdquo; said she,
      blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Montalais!&rdquo; said Raoul, paler than death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose unsteadily, and tried to make his way across the slippery mosaic
      of the floor; but she had comprehended that savage and cruel grief; she
      felt that in the flight of Raoul there was an accusation of herself. A
      woman, ever vigilant, she did not think she ought to let the opportunity
      slip of making good her justification; but Raoul, though stopped by her in
      the middle of the gallery, did not seem disposed to surrender without a
      combat. He took it up in a tone so cold and embarrassed, that if they had
      been thus surprised, the whole court would have no doubt about the
      proceedings of Mademoiselle de Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur,&rdquo; said she with disdain, &ldquo;what you are doing is very
      unworthy of a gentleman. My heart inclines me to speak to you; you
      compromise me by a reception almost uncivil; you are wrong, monsieur; and
      you confound your friends with enemies. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul had sworn never to speak of Louise, never even to look at those who
      might have seen Louise; he was going into another world, that he might
      never meet with anything Louise had seen, or even touched. But after the
      first shock of his pride, after having had a glimpse of Montalais, the
      companion of Louise&mdash;Montalais, who reminded him of the turret of
      Blois and the joys of youth&mdash;all his reason faded away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, mademoiselle; it enters not, it cannot enter into my thoughts
      to be uncivil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to speak to me?&rdquo; said she, with the smile of former days.
      &ldquo;Well! come somewhere else; for we may be surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the clock, doubtingly, then, having reflected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my apartment,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we shall have an hour to ourselves.&rdquo; And
      taking her course, lighter than a fairy, she ran up to her chamber,
      followed by Raoul. Shutting the door, and placing in the hands of her <i>cameriste</i>
      the mantle she had held upon her arm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were seeking M. de Guiche, were you not?&rdquo; said she to Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and ask him to come up here, presently, after I have spoken to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you angry with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul looked at her for a moment, then, casting down his eyes, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture, do
      you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rupture!&rdquo; said he, with bitterness. &ldquo;Oh! mademoiselle, there can be no
      rupture where there has been no love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in error,&rdquo; replied Montalais; &ldquo;Louise did love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with love, I know; but she liked you, and you ought to have married
      her before you set out for London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul broke into a sinister laugh, which made Montalais shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me that very much at your ease, mademoiselle. Do people marry
      whom they like? You forget that the king then kept for himself as his
      mistress her of whom we are speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the young woman, pressing the hands of Raoul in her own,
      &ldquo;you were wrong in every way; a man of your age ought never to leave a
      woman of hers alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no longer any faith in the world, then,&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, vicomte,&rdquo; said Montalais, quietly. &ldquo;Nevertheless, let me tell you
      that, if, instead of loving Louise coldly and philosophically, you had
      endeavored to awaken her to love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, I pray you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Raoul. &ldquo;I feel as though you are
      all, of both sexes, of a different age from me. You can laugh, and you can
      banter agreeably. I, mademoiselle, I loved Mademoiselle de&mdash;&rdquo; Raoul
      could not pronounce her name,&mdash;&ldquo;I loved her well! I put my faith in
      her&mdash;now I am quits by loving her no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, vicomte!&rdquo; said Montalais, pointing to his reflection in a
      looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean, mademoiselle; I am much altered, am I not? Well! Do
      you know why? Because my face is the mirror of my heart, the outer surface
      changed to match the mind within.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are consoled, then?&rdquo; said Montalais, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall never be consoled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, M. de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care but little for that. I do not quite understand myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not even tried to speak to Louise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who! I?&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, with eyes flashing fire; &ldquo;I!&mdash;Why
      do you not advise me to marry her? Perhaps the king would consent now.&rdquo;
       And he rose from his chair full of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montalais, &ldquo;that you are not cured, and that Louise has one
      enemy the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One enemy the more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; favorites are but little beloved at the court of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! while she has her lover to protect her, is not that enough? She has
      chosen him of such a quality that her enemies cannot prevail against her.&rdquo;
       But, stopping all at once, &ldquo;And then she has you for a friend,
      mademoiselle,&rdquo; added he, with a shade of irony which did not glide off the
      cuirass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who! I?&mdash;Oh, no! I am no longer one of those whom Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere condescends to look upon; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This <i>but</i>, so big with menace and with storm; this <i>but</i>, which
      made the heart of Raoul beat, such griefs did it presage for her whom
      lately he loved so dearly; this terrible <i>but</i>, so significant in a
      woman like Montalais, was interrupted by a moderately loud noise heard by
      the speakers proceeding from the alcove behind the wainscoting. Montalais
      turned to listen, and Raoul was already rising, when a lady entered the
      room quietly by the secret door, which she closed after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, on recognizing the sister-in-law of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid wretch!&rdquo; murmured Montalais, throwing herself, but too late,
      before the princess, &ldquo;I have been mistaken in an hour!&rdquo; She had, however,
      time to warn the princess, who was walking towards Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Bragelonne, Madame,&rdquo; and at these words the princess drew back,
      uttering a cry in her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royal highness,&rdquo; said Montalais, with volubility, &ldquo;is kind enough to
      think of this lottery, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess began to lose countenance. Raoul hastened his departure,
      without divining all, but he felt that he was in the way. Madame was
      preparing a word of transition to recover herself, when a closet opened in
      front of the alcove, and M. de Guiche issued, all radiant, also from that
      closet. The palest of the four, we must admit, was still Raoul. The
      princess, however, was near fainting, and was obliged to lean upon the
      foot of the bed for support. No one ventured to support her. This scene
      occupied several minutes of terrible suspense. But Raoul broke it. He went
      up to the count, whose inexpressible emotion made his knees tremble, and
      taking his hand, &ldquo;Dear count,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell Madame I am too unhappy not
      to merit pardon; tell her also that I have loved in the course of my life,
      and that the horror of the treachery that has been practiced on me renders
      me inexorable towards all other treachery that may be committed around me.
      This is why, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, smiling to Montalais, &ldquo;I never would
      divulge the secret of the visits of my friend to your apartment. Obtain
      from Madame&mdash;from Madame, who is so clement and so generous,&mdash;obtain
      her pardon for you whom she has just surprised also. You are both free,
      love each other, be happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess felt for a moment a despair that cannot be described; it was
      repugnant to her, notwithstanding the exquisite delicacy which Raoul had
      exhibited, to feel herself at the mercy of one who had discovered such an
      indiscretion. It was equally repugnant to her to accept the evasion
      offered by this delicate deception. Agitated, nervous, she struggled
      against the double stings of these two troubles. Raoul comprehended her
      position, and came once more to her aid. Bending his knee before her:
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, &ldquo;in two days I shall be far from Paris;
      in a fortnight I shall be far from France, where I shall never be seen
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going away, then?&rdquo; said she, with great delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With M. de Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into Africa!&rdquo; cried De Guiche, in his turn. &ldquo;You, Raoul&mdash;oh! my
      friend&mdash;into Africa, where everybody dies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And forgetting everything, forgetting that that forgetfulness itself
      compromised the princess more eloquently than his presence, &ldquo;Ingrate!&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;and you have not even consulted me!&rdquo; And he embraced him; during
      which time Montalais had led away Madame, and disappeared herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul passed his hand over his brow, and said, with a smile, &ldquo;I have been
      dreaming!&rdquo; Then warmly to Guiche, who by degrees absorbed him, &ldquo;My
      friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I conceal nothing from you, who are the elected of my
      heart. I am going to seek death in yonder country; your secret will not
      remain in my breast more than a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Raoul! a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what is my thought, count? This is it&mdash;I shall live more
      vividly, being buried beneath the earth, than I have lived for this month
      past. We are Christians, my friend, and if such sufferings were to
      continue, I would not be answerable for the safety of my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche was anxious to raise objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one word more on my account,&rdquo; said Raoul; &ldquo;but advice to you, dear
      friend; what I am going to say to you is of much greater importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt you risk much more than I do, because you love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a joy so sweet to me to be able to speak to you thus! Well, then,
      De Guiche, beware of Montalais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! of that kind friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was the friend of&mdash;her you know of. She ruined her by pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, when she has ruined her, she would ravish from her the only
      thing that renders that woman excusable in my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that there is a plot formed against her who is the mistress of the
      king&mdash;a plot formed in the very house of Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Montalais?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her as the least dangerous of the enemies I dread for&mdash;the
      other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself clearly, my friend; and if I can understand you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two words. Madame has been long jealous of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she has&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! fear nothing&mdash;you are beloved&mdash;you are beloved, count; do
      you feel the value of these three words? They signify that you can raise
      your head, that you can sleep tranquilly, that you can thank God every
      minute of you life. You are beloved; that signifies that you may hear
      everything, even the counsel of a friend who wishes to preserve your
      happiness. You are beloved, De Guiche, you are beloved! You do not endure
      those atrocious nights, those nights without end, which, with arid eye and
      fainting heart, others pass through who are destined to die. You will live
      long, if you act like the miser who, bit by bit, crumb by crumb, collects
      and heaps up diamonds and gold. You are beloved!&mdash;allow me to tell
      you what you must do that you may be beloved forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche contemplated for some time this unfortunate young man, half mad
      with despair, till there passed through his heart something like remorse
      at his own happiness. Raoul suppressed his feverish excitement, to assume
      the voice and countenance of an impassible man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will make her, whose name I should wish still to be able to
      pronounce&mdash;they will make her suffer. Swear to me that you will not
      second them in anything&mdash;but that you will defend her when possible,
      as I would have done myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I will,&rdquo; replied De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Raoul, &ldquo;some day, when you shall have rendered her a
      great service&mdash;some day when she shall thank you, promise me to say
      these words to her&mdash;&lsquo;I have done you this kindness, madame, at the
      warm request of M. de Bragelonne, whom you so deeply injured.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I will,&rdquo; murmured De Guiche.
    </p>
<p>
 &ldquo;That is all.  Adieu!  I set out to-morrow, or the day after, for
Toulon. If you have a few hours to spare, give them to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All! all!&rdquo; cried the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you going to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to meet M. le comte at Planchet&rsquo;s residence, where we hope to
      find M. d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I wish to embrace him before my departure. He is a brave man, who
      loves me dearly. Farewell, my friend; you are expected, no doubt; you will
      find me, when you wish, at the lodgings of the comte. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young men embraced. Those who chanced to see them both thus, would
      not have hesitated to say, pointing to Raoul, &ldquo;That is the happy man!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIX. Planchet&rsquo;s Inventory.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Athos, during the visit made to the Luxembourg by Raoul, had gone to
      Planchet&rsquo;s residence to inquire after D&rsquo;Artagnan. The comte, on arriving
      at the Rue des Lombards, found the shop of the grocer in great confusion;
      but it was not the encumberment of a lucky sale, or that of an arrival of
      goods. Planchet was not enthroned, as usual, on sacks and barrels. No. A
      young man with a pen behind his ear, and another with an account-book in
      his hand, were setting down a number of figures, whilst a third counted
      and weighed. An inventory was being taken. Athos, who had no knowledge of
      commercial matters, felt himself a little embarrassed by material
      obstacles and the majesty of those who were thus employed. He saw several
      customers sent away, and asked himself whether he, who came to buy
      nothing, would not be more properly deemed importunate. He therefore asked
      very politely if he could see M. Planchet. The reply, quite carelessly
      given, was that M. Planchet was packing his trunks. These words surprised
      Athos. &ldquo;What! his trunks?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;is M. Planchet going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you please, inform him that M. le Comte de la Fere desires to
      speak to him for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of the comte&rsquo;s name, one of the young men, no doubt
      accustomed to hear it pronounced with respect, immediately went to inform
      Planchet. It was at this moment that Raoul, after his painful scene with
      Montalais and De Guiche, arrived at the grocer&rsquo;s house. Planchet left his
      job directly he received the comte&rsquo;s message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur le comte!&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;how glad I am to see you! What
      good star brings you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Planchet,&rdquo; said Athos, pressing the hand of his son, whose sad
      look he silently observed,&mdash;&ldquo;we are come to learn of you&mdash;But in
      what confusion do I find you! You are as white as a miller; where have you
      been rummaging?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>diable!</i> take care, monsieur; don&rsquo;t come near me till I have
      well shaken myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? Flour or dust only whiten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; what you see on my arms is arsenic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsenic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am taking my precautions against rats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I suppose in an establishment like this, rats play a conspicuous
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not with this establishment I concern myself, monsieur le comte.
      The rats have robbed me of more here than they will ever rob me of again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you may have observed, monsieur, my inventory is being taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you leaving trade, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! <i>mon Dieu!</i> yes. I have disposed of my business to one of my
      young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! you are rich, then, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I have taken a dislike to the city; I don&rsquo;t know whether it is
      because I am growing old, and as M. d&rsquo;Artagnan one day said, when we grow
      old we more often think of the adventures of our youth; but for some time
      past I have felt myself attracted towards the country and gardening. I was
      a countryman formerly.&rdquo; And Planchet marked this confession with a rather
      pretentious laugh for a man making profession of humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos made a gesture of approval, and then added: &ldquo;You are going to buy an
      estate, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have bought one, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is still better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little house at Fontainebleau, with something like twenty acres of land
      round it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Planchet! Accept my compliments on your acquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, we are not comfortable here; the cursed dust makes you
      cough. <i>Corbleu!</i> I do not wish to poison the most worthy gentleman
      in the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos did not smile at this little pleasantry which Planchet had aimed at
      him, in order to try his strength in mundane facetiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;let us have a little talk by ourselves&mdash;in your
      own room, for example. You have a room, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, monsieur le comte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upstairs, perhaps?&rdquo; And Athos, seeing Planchet a little embarrassed,
      wished to relieve him by going first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; said Planchet, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos was mistaken in the cause of this hesitation, and, attributing it to
      a fear the grocer might have of offering humble hospitality, &ldquo;Never mind,
      never mind,&rdquo; said he, still going up, &ldquo;the dwelling of a tradesman in this
      quarter is not expected to be a palace. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul nimbly preceded him, and entered first. Two cries were heard
      simultaneously&mdash;we may say three. One of these cries dominated the
      others; it emanated from a woman. Another proceeded from the mouth of
      Raoul; it was an exclamation of surprise. He had no sooner uttered it than
      he shut the door sharply. The third was from fright; it came from
      Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask your pardon!&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;madame is dressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul had, no doubt, seen that what Planchet said was true, for he turned
      round to go downstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame&mdash;&rdquo; said Athos. &ldquo;Oh! pardon me, Planchet, I did not know that
      you had upstairs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Truchen,&rdquo; added Planchet, blushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is whoever you please, my good Planchet; but pardon my rudeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; go up now, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will do no such thing,&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame, having notice, has had time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Planchet; farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, gentlemen! you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the
      staircase, or by going away without having sat down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we had known you had a lady upstairs,&rdquo; replied Athos, with his
      customary coolness, &ldquo;we would have asked permission to pay our respects to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet was so disconcerted by this little extravagance, that he forced
      the passage, and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son.
      Truchen was quite dressed: in the costume of the shopkeeper&rsquo;s wife, rich
      yet coquettish; German eyes attacking French eyes. She left the apartment
      after two courtesies, and went down into the shop&mdash;but not without
      having listened at the door, to know what Planchet&rsquo;s gentlemen visitors
      would say of her. Athos suspected that, and therefore turned the
      conversation accordingly. Planchet, on his part, was burning to give
      explanations, which Athos avoided. But, as certain tenacities are stronger
      than others, Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls of
      felicity, translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus. So
      Planchet related how Truchen had charmed the years of his advancing age,
      and brought good luck to his business, as Ruth did to Boaz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want nothing now, then, but heirs to your property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres,&rdquo; said Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! you must have one, then,&rdquo; said Athos, phlegmatically, &ldquo;if only to
      prevent your little fortune being lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This word <i>little fortune</i> placed Planchet in his rank, like the
      voice of the sergeant when Planchet was but a <i>piqueur</i> in the
      regiment of Piedmont, in which Rochefort had placed him. Athos perceived
      that the grocer would marry Truchen, and, in spite of fate, establish a
      family. This appeared the more evident to him when he learned that the
      young man to whom Planchet was selling the business was her cousin. Having
      heard all that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring
      grocer, &ldquo;What is M. d&rsquo;Artagnan about?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he is not at the Louvre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur le comte, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan has disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappeared!&rdquo; said Athos, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur, we know what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever M. d&rsquo;Artagnan disappears it is always for some mission or some
      great affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he said anything to you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were acquainted with his departure for England formerly, were you
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of the speculation.&rdquo; said Planchet, heedlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The speculation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted Planchet, quite confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in
      question; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to
      you. Since the captain of the musketeers is not here, and as we cannot
      learn from you where we are likely to find M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, we will take our
      leave of you. <i>Au revoir</i>, Planchet, <i>au revoir</i>. Let us be
      gone, Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le comte, I wish I were able to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all; I am not the man to reproach a servant with discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; struck rudely on the ears of the <i>demi-millionnaire</i>
      Planchet, but natural respect and <i>bonhomie</i> prevailed over pride.
      &ldquo;There is nothing indiscreet in telling you, monsieur le comte, M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan came here the other day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remained several hours consulting a geographical chart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, then, my friend; say no more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the chart is there as a proof,&rdquo; added Planchet, who went to fetch
      from the neighboring wall, where it was suspended by a twist, forming a
      triangle with the bar of the window to which it was fastened, the plan
      consulted by the captain on his last visit to Planchet. This plan, which
      he brought to the comte, was a map of France, upon which the practiced eye
      of that gentleman discovered an itinerary, marked out with small pins;
      wherever a pin was missing, a hole denoted its having been there. Athos,
      by following with his eye the pins and holes, saw that D&rsquo;Artagnan had
      taken the direction of the south, and gone as far as the Mediterranean,
      towards Toulon. It was near Cannes that the marks and the punctured places
      ceased. The Comte de la Fere puzzled his brains for some time, to divine
      what the musketeer could be going to do at Cannes, and what motive could
      have led him to examine the banks of the Var. The reflections of Athos
      suggested nothing. His accustomed perspicacity was at fault. Raoul&rsquo;s
      researches were not more successful than his father&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the young man to the comte, who silently, and with his
      finger, had made him understand the route of D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;we must confess
      that there is a Providence always occupied in connecting our destiny with
      that of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan. There he is on the coast of Cannes, and you,
      monsieur, will, at least, conduct me as far as Toulon. Be assured that we
      shall meet with him more easily upon our route than on this map.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, taking leave of Planchet, who was scolding his shopmen, even the
      cousin of Truchen, his successor, the gentlemen set out to pay a visit to
      M. de Beaufort. On leaving the grocer&rsquo;s shop, they saw a coach, the future
      depository of the charms of Mademoiselle Truchen and Planchet&rsquo;s bags of
      crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one journeys towards happiness by the route he chooses,&rdquo; said
      Raoul, in a melancholy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Road to Fontainebleau!&rdquo; cried Planchet to his coachman.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXX. The Inventory of M. de Beaufort.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To have talked of D&rsquo;Artagnan with Planchet, to have seen Planchet quit
      Paris to bury himself in his country retreat, had been for Athos and his
      son like a last farewell to the noise of the capital&mdash;to their life
      of former days. What, in fact, did these men leave behind them&mdash;one
      of whom had exhausted the past age in glory, and the other, the present
      age in misfortune? Evidently neither of them had anything to ask of his
      contemporaries. They had only to pay a visit to M. de Beaufort, and
      arrange with him the particulars of departure. The duke was lodged
      magnificently in Paris. He had one of those superb establishments
      pertaining to great fortunes, the like of which certain old men remembered
      to have seen in all their glory in the times of wasteful liberality of
      Henry III.&lsquo;s reign. Then, really, several great nobles were richer than
      the king. They knew it, used it, and never deprived themselves of the
      pleasure of humiliating his royal majesty when they had an opportunity. It
      was this egotistical aristocracy Richelieu had constrained to contribute,
      with its blood, its purse, and its duties, to what was from his time
      styled the king&rsquo;s service. From Louis XI.&mdash;that terrible mower-down
      of the great&mdash;to Richelieu, how many families had raised their heads!
      How many, from Richelieu to Louis XIV., had bowed their heads, never to
      raise them again! But M. de Beaufort was born a prince, and of a blood
      which is not shed upon scaffolds, unless by the decree of peoples,&mdash;a
      prince who had kept up a grand style of living. How did he maintain his
      horses, his people, and his table? Nobody knew; himself less than others.
      Only there were then privileges for the sons of kings, to whom nobody
      refused to become a creditor, whether from respect or the persuasion that
      they would some day be paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos and Raoul found the mansion of the duke in as much confusion as that
      of Planchet. The duke, likewise, was making his inventory; that is to say,
      he was distributing to his friends everything of value he had in his
      house. Owing nearly two millions&mdash;an enormous amount in those days&mdash;M.
      de Beaufort had calculated that he could not set out for Africa without a
      good round sum, and, in order to find that sum, he was distributing to his
      old creditors plate, arms, jewels, and furniture, which was more
      magnificent in selling it, and brought him back double. In fact, how could
      a man to whom ten thousand livres were owing, refuse to carry away a
      present worth six thousand, enhanced in estimation from having belonged to
      a descendant of Henry IV.? And how, after having carried away that
      present, could he refuse ten thousand livres more to this generous noble?
      This, then, was what had happened. The duke had no longer a dwelling-house&mdash;that
      had become useless to an admiral whose place of residence is his ship; he
      had no longer need of superfluous arms, when he was placed amidst his
      cannons; no more jewels, which the sea might rob him of; but he had three
      or four hundred thousand crowns fresh in his coffers. And throughout the
      house there was a joyous movement of people who believed they were
      plundering monseigneur. The prince had, in a supreme degree, the art of
      making happy the creditors most to be pitied. Every distressed man, every
      empty purse, found in him patience and sympathy for his position. To some
      he said, &ldquo;I wish I had what <i>you</i> have; I would give it you.&rdquo; And to
      others, &ldquo;I have but this silver ewer; it is worth at least five hundred
      livres,&mdash;take it.&rdquo; The effect of which was&mdash;so truly is courtesy
      a current payment&mdash;that the prince constantly found means to renew
      his creditors. This time he used no ceremony; it might be called a general
      pillage. He gave up everything. The Oriental fable of the poor Arab who
      carried away from the pillage of palace a kettle at the bottom of which
      was concealed a bag of gold, and whom everybody allowed to pass without
      jealousy,&mdash;this fable had become a truth in the prince&rsquo;s mansion.
      Many contractors paid themselves upon the offices of the duke. Thus, the
      provision department, who plundered the clothes-presses and the
      harness-rooms, attached very little value to things which tailors and
      saddlers set great store by. Anxious to carry home to their wives presents
      given them by monseigneur, many were seen bounding joyously along, under
      the weight of earthen jars and bottles, gloriously stamped with the arms
      of the prince. M. de Beaufort finished by giving away his horses and the
      hay from his lofts. He made more than thirty happy with kitchen utensils;
      and thirty more with the contents of his cellar. Still further; all these
      people went away with the conviction that M. de Beaufort only acted in
      this manner to prepare for a new fortune concealed beneath the Arabs&rsquo;
      tents. They repeated to each other, while pillaging his hotel, that he was
      sent to Gigelli by the king to reconstruct his lost fortunes; that the
      treasures of Africa would be equally divided between the admiral and the
      king of France; that these treasures consisted in mines of diamonds, or
      other fabulous stones; the gold and silver mines of Mount Atlas did not
      even obtain the honor of being named. In addition to the mines to be
      worked&mdash;which could not be begun till after the campaign&mdash;there
      would be the booty made by the army. M. de Beaufort would lay his hands on
      all the riches pirates had robbed Christendom of since the battle of
      Lepanto. The number of millions from these sources defied calculation.
      Why, then, should he, who was going in quest of such treasure, set any
      store by the poor utensils of his past life? And reciprocally, why should
      they spare the property of him who spared it so little himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the position of affairs. Athos, with his piercing practiced
      glance, saw what was going on at once. He found the admiral of France a
      little exalted, for he was rising from a table of fifty covers, at which
      the guests had drunk long and deeply to the prosperity of the expedition;
      at the conclusion of which repast, the remains, with the dessert, had been
      given to the servants, and the empty dishes and plates to the curious. The
      prince was intoxicated with his ruin and his popularity at one and the
      same time. He had drunk his old wine to the health of his wine of the
      future. When he saw Athos and Raoul:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my aide-de-camp being brought to me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come hither,
      comte; come hither, vicomte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos tried to find a passage through the heaps of linen and plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! step over, step over!&rdquo; said the duke, offering a full glass to Athos.
      The latter drank it; Raoul scarcely moistened his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is your commission,&rdquo; said the prince to Raoul. &ldquo;I had prepared it,
      reckoning upon you. You will go before me as far as Antibes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the order.&rdquo; And De Beaufort gave Raoul the order. &ldquo;Do you know
      anything of the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur; I have traveled with M. le Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. All these barges and lighters must be in attendance to form
      an escort and carry my provisions. The army must be prepared to embark in
      a fortnight at the very latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shall be done, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The present order gives you the right to visit and search all the isles
      along the coast; you will there make the enrolments and levies you may
      want for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur le duc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are an active man, and will work freely, you will spend much
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am sure you will. My intendant has prepared the orders of a
      thousand livres, drawn upon the cities of the south; he will give you a
      hundred of them. Now, dear vicomte, be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos interrupted the prince. &ldquo;Keep your money, monseigneur; war is to be
      waged among the Arabs with gold as well as lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to try the contrary,&rdquo; replied the duke; &ldquo;and then you are
      acquainted with my ideas upon the expedition&mdash;plenty of noise, plenty
      of fire, and, if so it must be, I shall disappear in the smoke.&rdquo; Having
      spoken thus, M. de Beaufort began to laugh; but his mirth was not
      reciprocated by Athos and Raoul. He perceived this at once. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he,
      with the courteous egotism of his rank and age, &ldquo;you are such people as a
      man should not see after dinner; you are cold, stiff, and dry when I am
      all fire, suppleness, and wine. No, devil take me! I should always see you
      fasting, vicomte, and you, comte, if you wear such a face as that, you
      shall see me no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this, pressing the hand of Athos, who replied with a smile,
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, do not talk so grandly because you happen to have plenty of
      money. I predict that within a month you will be dry, stiff, and cold, in
      presence of your strong-box, and that then, having Raoul at your elbow,
      fasting, you will be surprised to see him gay, animated, and generous,
      because he will have some new crowns to offer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it may be so!&rdquo; cried the delighted duke. &ldquo;Comte, stay with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall go with Raoul; the mission with which you charge him is a
      troublesome and difficult one. Alone it would be too much for him to
      execute. You do not observe, monseigneur, you have given him command of
      the first order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in your naval arrangements, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be true. But one finds that such fine young fellows as your son
      generally do all that is required of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, I believe you will find nowhere so much zeal and
      intelligence, so much real bravery, as in Raoul; but if he failed to
      arrange your embarkation, you would only meet the fate that you deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! you are scolding me, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, to provision a fleet, to assemble a flotilla, to enroll your
      maritime force, would take an admiral a year. Raoul is a cavalry officer,
      and you allow him a fortnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you he will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may; but I will go and help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure you will; I reckoned upon you, and still further believe that
      when we are once at Toulon you will not let him depart alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Athos, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience! patience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, permit us to take our leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begone, then, and may my good luck attend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu! monseigneur; and may your own good luck attend you likewise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is an expedition admirably commenced!&rdquo; said Athos to his son. &ldquo;No
      provisions&mdash;no store flotilla! What can be done, thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; murmured Raoul; &ldquo;if all are going to do as I am, provisions will
      not be wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Athos, sternly, &ldquo;do not be unjust and senseless in
      your egotism, or your grief, whichever you please to call it. If you set
      out for this war solely with the intention of getting killed therein, you
      stand in need of nobody, and it was scarcely worth while to recommend you
      to M. de Beaufort. But when you have been introduced to the prime
      commandant&mdash;when you have accepted the responsibility of a post in
      his army, the question is no longer about <i>you</i>, but about all those
      poor soldiers, who, as well as you, have hearts and bodies, who will weep
      for their country and endure all the necessities of their condition.
      Remember, Raoul, that officers are ministers as useful to the world as
      priests, and that they ought to have more charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I know it and have practiced it; I would have continued to do
      so still, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget also that you are of a country that is proud of its military
      glory; go and die if you like, but do not die without honor and without
      advantage to France. Cheer up, Raoul! do not let my words grieve you; I
      love you, and wish to see you perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love your reproaches, monsieur,&rdquo; said the young man, mildly; &ldquo;they
      alone may cure me, because they prove to me that some one loves me still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Raoul, let us be off; the weather is so fine, the heavens so
      clear, those heavens which we always find above our heads, which you will
      see more clear still at Gigelli, and which will speak to you of me there,
      as they speak to me here of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen, after having agreed on this point, talked over the wild
      freaks of the duke, convinced that France would be served in a very
      incomplete manner, as regarded both spirit and practice, in the ensuing
      expedition; and having summed up the ducal policy under the one word
      vanity, they set forward, in obedience rather to their will than destiny.
      The sacrifice was half accomplished.

    <p>
      The journey passed off pretty well. Athos and his son traversed France at
      the rate of fifteen leagues per day; sometimes more, sometimes less,
      according to the intensity of Raoul&rsquo;s grief. It took them a fortnight to
      reach Toulon, and they lost all traces of D&rsquo;Artagnan at Antibes. They were
      forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous of
      preserving an incognito on his route, for Athos derived from his inquiries
      an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged his horse
      for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon. Raoul was much affected at
      not meeting with D&rsquo;Artagnan. His affectionate heart longed to take a
      farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel. Athos knew
      from experience that D&rsquo;Artagnan became impenetrable when engaged in any
      serious affair, whether on his own account or on the service of the king.
      He even feared to offend his friend, or thwart him by too pressing
      inquiries. And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of classing the
      flotilla, and got together the <i>chalands</i> and lighters to send them
      to Toulon, one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat had been laid
      up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a gentleman who was in
      great haste to embark. Athos, believing that this man was telling a
      falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish, and so gain more money
      when all his companions were gone, insisted upon having the details. The
      fisherman informed him that six days previously, a man had come in the
      night to hire his boat, for the purpose of visiting the island of St.
      Honnorat. The price was agreed upon, but the gentleman had arrived with an
      immense carriage case, which he insisted upon embarking, in spite of the
      many difficulties that opposed the operation. The fisherman wished to
      retract. He had even threatened, but his threats had procured him nothing
      but a shower of blows from the gentleman&rsquo;s cane, which fell upon his
      shoulders sharp and long. Swearing and grumbling, he had recourse to the
      syndic of his brotherhood at Antibes, who administer justice among
      themselves and protect each other; but the gentleman had exhibited a
      certain paper, at sight of which the syndic, bowing to the very ground,
      enjoined obedience from the fisherman, and abused him for having been
      refractory. They then departed with the freight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this does not tell us,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;how you injured your boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the way. I was steering towards St. Honnorat as the gentleman
      desired me; but he changed his mind, and pretended that I could not pass
      to the south of the abbey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, monsieur, there is in front of the square tower of the
      Benedictines, towards the southern point, the bank of the <i>Moines</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rock?&rdquo; asked Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Level with the water, but below water; a dangerous passage, yet one I
      have cleared a thousand times; the gentleman required me to land him at
      Sainte-Marguerite&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur!&rdquo; cried the fisherman, with his <i>Provencal</i> accent,
      &ldquo;a man is a sailor, or he is not; he knows his course, or he is nothing
      but a fresh-water lubber. I was obstinate, and wished to try the channel.
      The gentleman took me by the collar, and told me quietly he would strangle
      me. My mate armed himself with a hatchet, and so did I. We had the affront
      of the night before to pay him out for. But the gentleman drew his sword,
      and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner, that we neither of us
      could get near him. I was about to hurl my hatchet at his head, and I had
      a right to do so, hadn&rsquo;t I, monsieur? for a sailor aboard is master, as a
      citizen is in his chamber; I was going, then, in self-defense, to cut the
      gentleman in two, when, all at once&mdash;believe me or not, monsieur&mdash;the
      great carriage case opened of itself, I don&rsquo;t know how, and there came out
      of it a sort of a phantom, his head covered with a black helmet and a
      black mask, something terrible to look upon, which came towards me
      threatening with its fist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was&mdash;&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the devil, monsieur; for the gentleman, with great glee, cried
      out, on seeing him: &lsquo;Ah! thank you, monseigneur!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most strange story!&rdquo; murmured the comte, looking at Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo; asked the latter of the fisherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know, monsieur, that two poor men, such as we are, could be no
      match for two gentlemen; but when one of them turned out to be the devil,
      we had no earthly chance! My companion and I did not stop to consult one
      another; we made but one jump into the sea, for we were within seven or
      eight hundred feet of the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, and then, monseigneur, as there was a little wind from the
      southwest, the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;but the travelers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! you need not be uneasy about them! It was pretty plain that one was
      the devil, and protected the other; for when we recovered the boat, after
      she got afloat again, instead of finding these two creatures injured by
      the shock, we found nothing, not even the carriage or the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very strange! very strange!&rdquo; repeated the comte. &ldquo;But after that, what
      did you do, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite&rsquo;s, who brought
      my finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly
      stories he would have me flogged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! did the governor himself say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; and yet my boat was injured, seriously injured, for the
      prow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite&rsquo;s, and the carpenter asks
      a hundred and twenty livres to repair it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Raoul; &ldquo;you will be exempted from the service. Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go to Sainte-Marguerite&rsquo;s, shall we?&rdquo; said the comte to
      Bragelonne, as the man walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, for there is something to be cleared up; that man does not
      seem to me to have told the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to me either, Raoul. The story of the masked man and the carriage
      having disappeared, may be told to conceal some violence these fellows
      have committed upon their passengers in the open sea, to punish him for
      his persistence in embarking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I formed the same suspicion; the carriage was more likely to contain
      property than a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see to that, Raoul. The gentleman very much resembles
      D&rsquo;Artagnan; I recognize his methods of proceeding. Alas! we are no longer
      the young invincibles of former days. Who knows whether the hatchet or the
      iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in doing that which
      the best blades of Europe, balls, and bullets have not been able to do in
      forty years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite&rsquo;s, on board a <i>chasse-maree</i>
      come from Toulon under orders. The impression they experienced on landing
      was a singularly pleasing one. The island seemed loaded with flowers and
      fruits. In its cultivated part it served as a garden for the governor.
      Orange, pomegranate, and fig trees bent beneath the weight of their golden
      or purple fruits. All round this garden, in the uncultivated parts, red
      partridges ran about in conveys among the brambles and tufts of junipers,
      and at every step of the comte and Raoul a terrified rabbit quitted his
      thyme and heath to scuttle away to the burrow. In fact, this fortunate
      isle was uninhabited. Flat, offering nothing but a tiny bay for the
      convenience of embarkation, and under the protection of the governor, who
      went shares with them, smugglers made use of it as a provisional <i>entrepot</i>,
      at the expense of not killing the game or devastating the garden. With
      this compromise, the governor was in a situation to be satisfied with a
      garrison of eight men to guard his fortress, in which twelve cannons
      accumulated coats of moldy green. The governor was a sort of happy farmer,
      harvesting wines, figs, oil, and oranges, preserving his citrons and <i>cedrates</i>
      in the sun of his casemates. The fortress, encircled by a deep ditch, its
      only guardian, arose like three heads upon turrets connected with each
      other by terraces covered with moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden
      without finding any one to introduce them to the governor. They ended by
      making their own way into the garden. It was at the hottest time of the
      day. Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone. The
      heavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises, to envelop
      all existences; the rabbit under the broom, the fly under the leaf, slept
      as the wave did beneath the heavens. Athos saw nothing living but a
      soldier, upon the terrace beneath the second and third court, who was
      carrying a basket of provisions on his head. This man returned almost
      immediately without his basket, and disappeared in the shade of his
      sentry-box. Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some one,
      and, after having done so, returned to dine himself. All at once they
      heard some one call out, and raising their heads, perceived in the frame
      of the bars of the window something of a white color, like a hand that was
      waved backwards and forwards&mdash;something shining, like a polished
      weapon struck by the rays of the sun. And before they were able to
      ascertain what it was, a luminous train, accompanied by a hissing sound in
      the air, called their attention from the donjon to the ground. A second
      dull noise was heard from the ditch, and Raoul ran to pick up a silver
      plate which was rolling along the dry sand. The hand that had thrown this
      plate made a sign to the two gentlemen, and then disappeared. Athos and
      Raoul, approaching each other, commenced an attentive examination of the
      dusty plate, and they discovered, in characters traced upon the bottom of
      it with the point of a knife, this inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I am the brother of the king of France&mdash;a prisoner to-day&mdash;a
      madman to-morrow. French gentlemen and Christians, pray to God for the
      soul and the reason of the son of your old rulers</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plate fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring to
      make out the meaning of these dismal words. At the same moment they heard
      a cry from the top of the donjon. Quick as lightning Raoul bent down his
      head, and forced down that of his father likewise. A musket-barrel
      glittered from the crest of the wall. A white smoke floated like a plume
      from the mouth of the musket, and a ball was flattened against a stone
      within six inches of the two gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cordieu!</i>&rdquo; cried Athos. &ldquo;What, are people assassinated here? Come
      down, cowards as you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, come down!&rdquo; cried Raoul, furiously shaking his fist at the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the assailants&mdash;he who was about to fire&mdash;replied to
      these cries by an exclamation of surprise; and, as his companion, who
      wished to continue the attack, had re-seized his loaded musket, he who had
      cried out threw up the weapon, and the ball flew into the air. Athos and
      Raoul, seeing them disappear from the platform, expected they would come
      down to them, and waited with a firm demeanor. Five minutes had not
      elapsed, when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the
      garrison to arms, and they showed themselves on the other side of the
      ditch with their muskets in hand. At the head of these men was an officer,
      whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the first musket.
      The man ordered the soldiers to &ldquo;make ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to be shot!&rdquo; cried Raoul; &ldquo;but, sword in hand, at least, let
      us leap the ditch! We shall kill at least two of these scoundrels, when
      their muskets are empty.&rdquo; And, suiting the action to the word, Raoul was
      springing forward, followed by Athos, when a well-known voice resounded
      behind them, &ldquo;Athos! Raoul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; replied the two gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recover arms! <i>Mordioux!</i>&rdquo; cried the captain to the soldiers. &ldquo;I was
      sure I could not be mistaken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; asked Athos. &ldquo;What! were we to be shot
      without warning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I who was going to shoot you, and if the governor missed you, I
      should not have missed you, my dear friends. How fortunate it is that I am
      accustomed to take a long aim, instead of firing at the instant I raise my
      weapon! I thought I recognized you. Ah! my dear friends, how fortunate!&rdquo;
       And D&rsquo;Artagnan wiped his brow, for he had run fast, and emotion with him
      was not feigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Athos. &ldquo;And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of
      the fortress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did he fire at us? What have we done to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> You received what the prisoner threw to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That plate&mdash;the prisoner has written something on it, has he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! I was afraid he had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And D&rsquo;Artagnan, with all the marks of mortal disquietude, seized the
      plate, to read the inscription. When he had read it, a fearful pallor
      spread across his countenance. &ldquo;Oh! good heavens!&rdquo; repeated he. &ldquo;Silence!&mdash;Here
      is the governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will he do to us? Is it our fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, then?&rdquo; said Athos, in a subdued voice. &ldquo;It is true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! I tell you&mdash;silence! If he only believes you can read; if
      he only suspects you have understood; I love you, my dear friends, I would
      willingly be killed for you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Athos and Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you from
      death. Silence, then! Silence again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governor came up, having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said he to D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;what stops us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Spaniards&mdash;you do not understand a word of French,&rdquo; said the
      captain, eagerly, to his friends in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; replied he, addressing the governor, &ldquo;I was right; these gentlemen
      are two Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres, last year;
      they don&rsquo;t know a word of French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the governor, sharply. &ldquo;And yet they were trying to read the
      inscription on the plate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan took it out of his hands, effacing the characters with the
      point of his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; cried the governor, &ldquo;what are you doing? I cannot read them now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a state secret,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, bluntly; &ldquo;and as you know
      that, according to the king&rsquo;s orders, it is under the penalty of death any
      one should penetrate it, I will, if you like, allow you to read it, and
      have you shot immediately afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this apostrophe&mdash;half serious, half ironical&mdash;Athos and
      Raoul preserved the coolest, most unconcerned silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, is it possible,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;that these gentlemen do not
      comprehend at least some words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose they do! If they do understand a few spoken words, it does not
      follow that they should understand what is written. They cannot even read
      Spanish. A noble Spaniard, remember, ought never to know how to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations, but he
      was still tenacious. &ldquo;Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will willingly do. I was about to propose it to you.&rdquo; The fact is,
      the captain had quite another idea, and would have wished his friends a
      hundred leagues off. But he was obliged to make the best of it. He
      addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish, giving them a polite invitation,
      which they accepted. They all turned towards the entrance of the fort,
      and, the incident being at an end, the eight soldiers returned to their
      delightful leisure, for a moment disturbed by this unexpected adventure.

      Chapter XXXII. Captive and Jailers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When they had entered the fort, and whilst the governor was making some
      preparations for the reception of his guests, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;let us
      have a word of explanation whilst we are alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simply this,&rdquo; replied the musketeer. &ldquo;I have conducted hither a
      prisoner, who the king commands shall not be seen. You came here, he has
      thrown something to you through the lattice of his window; I was at dinner
      with the governor, I saw the object thrown, and I saw Raoul pick it up. It
      does not take long to understand this. I understood it, and I thought you
      in intelligence with my prisoner. And then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;you commanded us to be shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> I admit it; but, if I was the first to seize a musket,
      fortunately, I was the last to take aim at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had killed me, D&rsquo;Artagnan, I should have had the good fortune to
      die for the royal house of France, and it would be an honor to die by your
      hand&mdash;you, its noblest and most loyal defender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil, Athos, do you mean by the royal house?&rdquo; stammered
      D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you, a well-informed and sensible man,
      can place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With so much the more reason, my dear chevalier, from your having orders
      to kill all those who do believe in it,&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because,&rdquo; replied the captain of the musketeers&mdash;&ldquo;because
      every calumny, however absurd it may be, has the almost certain chance of
      becoming popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; replied Athos, promptly; &ldquo;but because the king is not
      willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people,
      and cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not talk in such a childish manner, Athos, or I shall begin to think
      you have lost your senses. Besides, explain to me how it is possible Louis
      XIII. should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son whom you have brought hither masked, in a fishing-boat,&rdquo; said
      Athos. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was brought to a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;whence do you know that a fishing-boat&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite&rsquo;s with the carriage containing the
      prisoner&mdash;with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur. Oh! I am
      acquainted with all that,&rdquo; resumed the comte. D&rsquo;Artagnan bit his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I had brought hither in a boat and with
      a carriage a masked prisoner, nothing proves that this prisoner must be a
      prince&mdash;a prince of the house of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Aramis such riddles,&rdquo; replied Athos, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis,&rdquo; cried the musketeer, quite at a stand. &ldquo;Have you seen Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After his discomfiture at Vaux, yes; I have seen Aramis, a fugitive,
      pursued, bewildered, ruined; and Aramis has told me enough to make me
      believe in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the
      bottom of the plate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s head sunk on his breast in some confusion. &ldquo;This is the way,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;in which God turns to nothing that which men call wisdom! A fine
      secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons hold the tattered
      fragments! Athos, cursed be the chance which has brought you face to face
      with me in this affair! for now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Athos, with his customary mild severity, &ldquo;is your secret lost
      because I know it? Consult your memory, my friend. Have I not borne
      secrets heavier than this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never borne one so dangerous,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a tone of
      sadness. &ldquo;I have something like a sinister idea that all who are concerned
      with this secret will die, and die unhappily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The will of God be done!&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;but here is your governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts. The governor,
      suspicious and hard, behaved towards D&rsquo;Artagnan with a politeness almost
      amounting to obsequiousness. With respect to the travelers, he contented
      himself with offering good cheer, and never taking his eye from them.
      Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried to embarrass them by sudden
      attacks, or to catch them off their guard; but neither the one nor the
      other gave him the least advantage. What D&rsquo;Artagnan had said was probable,
      if the governor did not believe it to be quite true. They rose from the
      table to repose awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this man&rsquo;s name? I don&rsquo;t like the looks of him,&rdquo; said Athos to
      D&rsquo;Artagnan in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Saint-Mars,&rdquo; replied the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, then, I suppose, the prince&rsquo;s jailer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! how can I tell? I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, not you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the
      midst of a desert. He would like to carry it away, but he cannot; he would
      like to leave it, but he dares not. The king will not dare to recall me,
      for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do; he regrets not
      having me near him, from being aware that no one would be of so much
      service near his person as myself. But it will happen as it may please
      God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Raoul, &ldquo;your not being certain proves that your situation
      here is provisional, and you will return to Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask these gentlemen,&rdquo; interrupted the governor, &ldquo;what was their purpose
      in coming to Saint-Marguerite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at
      Sainte-Honnorat which is considered curious; and from being told there was
      excellent shooting in the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite at their service, as well as yours,&rdquo; replied Saint-Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan politely thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will they depart?&rdquo; added the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds, and left D&rsquo;Artagnan alone with
      the pretended Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the musketeer, &ldquo;here is a life and a society that suits me
      very little. I command this man, and he bores me, <i>mordioux!</i> Come,
      let us have a shot or two at the rabbits; the walk will be beautiful, and
      not fatiguing. The whole island is but a league and a half in length, with
      the breadth of a league; a real park. Let us try to amuse ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, D&rsquo;Artagnan; not for the sake of amusing ourselves, but to
      gain an opportunity for talking freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made a sign to a soldier, who brought the gentlemen some guns,
      and then returned to the fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the musketeer, &ldquo;answer me the question put to you by that
      black-looking Saint-Mars: what did you come to do at the Lerin Isles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bid you farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bid me farewell! What do you mean by that? Is Raoul going anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With M. de Beaufort it is, my dear friend. You always guess correctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the two friends were commencing their conversation, Raoul, with his
      head hanging down and his heart oppressed, seated himself on a mossy rock,
      his gun across his knees, looking at the sea&mdash;looking at the heavens,
      and listening to the voice of his soul; he allowed the sportsmen to attain
      a considerable distance from him. D&rsquo;Artagnan remarked his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not recovered the blow?&rdquo; said he to Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is struck to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! your fears exaggerate, I hope. Raoul is of a tempered nature. Around
      all hearts as noble as his, there is a second envelope that forms a
      cuirass. The first bleeds, the second resists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Athos, &ldquo;Raoul will die of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordioux!</i>&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a melancholy tone. And he did not
      add a word to this exclamation. Then, a minute after, &ldquo;Why do you let him
      go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he insists on going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you not go with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I could not bear to see him die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan looked his friend earnestly in the face. &ldquo;You know one thing,&rdquo;
       continued the comte, leaning upon the arm of the captain; &ldquo;you know that
      in the course of my life I have been afraid of but few things. Well! I
      have an incessant gnawing, insurmountable fear that an hour will come in
      which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will die, I know, I have a perfect conviction of that; but I would not
      see him die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this, Athos? you come and place yourself in the presence of the
      bravest man, you say you have ever seen, of your own D&rsquo;Artagnan, of that
      man without an equal, as you formerly called him, and you come and tell
      him, with your arms folded, that you are afraid of witnessing the death of
      your son, you who have seen all that can be seen in this world! Why have
      you this fear, Athos? Man upon this earth must expect everything, and
      ought to face everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my friend. After having worn myself out upon this earth of
      which you speak, I have preserved but two religions: that of life,
      friendship, my duty as a father&mdash;that of eternity, love, and respect
      for God. Now, I have within me the revelation that if God should decree
      that my friend or my son should render up his last sigh in my presence&mdash;oh!
      no, I cannot even tell you, D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, speak, tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am strong against everything, except against the death of those I love.
      For that only there is no remedy. He who dies, gains; he who sees others
      die, loses. No, this is it&mdash;to know that I should no more meet on
      earth him whom I now behold with joy; to know that there would nowhere be
      a D&rsquo;Artagnan any more, nowhere again be a Raoul, oh! I am old, look you, I
      have no longer courage; I pray God to spare me in my weakness; but if he
      struck me so plainly and in that fashion, I should curse him. A Christian
      gentleman ought not to curse his God, D&rsquo;Artagnan; it is enough to once
      have cursed a king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sighed D&rsquo;Artagnan, a little confused by this violent tempest of
      grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me speak to him, Athos. Who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try, if you please, but I am convinced you will not succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not attempt to console him. I will serve him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, I will. Do you think this would be the first time a woman had
      repented of an infidelity? I will go to him, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos shook his head, and continued his walk alone, D&rsquo;Artagnan, cutting
      across the brambles, rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him. &ldquo;Well,
      Raoul! You have something to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a kindness to ask of you,&rdquo; replied Bragelonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will some day return to France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought I to write to Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you must not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have many things to say to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and say them to her, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might
      not possess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves the king,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, bluntly; &ldquo;and she is an honest
      girl.&rdquo; Raoul started. &ldquo;And you, you whom she abandons, she, perhaps, loves
      better than she does the king, but after another fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan, do you believe she loves the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To idolatry. Her heart is inaccessible to any other feeling. You might
      continue to live near her, and would be her best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a
      hideous hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be base.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very absurd word, which would lead me to think slightly of your
      understanding. Please to understand, Raoul, that it is never base to do
      that which is imposed upon us by a superior force. If your heart says to
      you, &lsquo;Go there, or die,&rsquo; why go, Raoul. Was she base or brave, she whom
      you loved, in preferring the king to you, the king whom her heart
      commanded her imperiously to prefer to you? No, she was the bravest of
      women. Do, then, as she has done. Oblige yourself. Do you know one thing
      of which I am sure, Raoul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! you would cease to love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am decided, my dear D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To set off to see her again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; to set off that I may <i>never</i> see her again. I wish to love her
      forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I must confess,&rdquo; replied the musketeer, &ldquo;that is a conclusion which I
      was far from expecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I wish, my friend. You will see her again, and you will give
      her a letter which, if you think proper, will explain to her, as to
      yourself, what is passing in my heart. Read it; I drew it up last night.
      Something told me I should see you to-day.&rdquo; He held the letter out, and
      D&rsquo;Artagnan read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MADEMOISELLE,&mdash;You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me. You
      have only been guilty of one fault towards me, that of having left me to
      believe you loved me. This error will cost me my life. I pardon you, but I
      cannot pardon myself. It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the sorrows
      of rejected lovers. It will not be so with you, who did not love me, save
      with anxiety. I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring to change
      that friendship into love, you would have yielded out of a fear of
      bringing about my death, or lessening the esteem I had for you. It is much
      more delightful to me to die, knowing that <i>you</i> are free and
      satisfied. How much, then, will you love me, when you will no longer fear
      either my presence or reproaches? You will love me, because, however
      charming a new love may appear to you, God has not made me in anything
      inferior to him you have chosen, and because my devotedness, my sacrifice,
      and my painful end will assure me, in your eyes, a certain superiority
      over him. I have allowed to escape, in the candid credulity of my heart,
      the treasure I possessed. Many people tell me that you loved me enough to
      lead me to hope you would have loved me much. That idea takes from my mind
      all bitterness, and leads me only to blame myself. You will accept this
      last farewell, and you will bless me for having taken refuge in the
      inviolable asylum where hatred is extinguished, and where all love endures
      forever. Adieu, mademoiselle. If your happiness could be purchased by the
      last drop of my blood, I would shed that drop. I willingly make the
      sacrifice of it to my misery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RAOUL, VICOTME DE BRAGELONNE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter reads very well,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I have only one fault to
      find with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what that is!&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is that it tells everything, except the thing which exhales, like
      a mortal poison from your eyes and from your heart; except the senseless
      love which still consumes you.&rdquo; Raoul grew paler, but remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not write simply these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;MADEMOISELLE,&mdash;Instead of cursing you, I love you and I die.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, with a sinister kind of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And tearing the letter he had just taken back, he wrote the following
      words upon a leaf of his tablets:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you, I commit
      the baseness of writing to you; and to punish myself for that baseness, I
      die.&rdquo; And he signed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give her these tablets, captain, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the day,&rdquo; said Bragelonne, pointing to the last sentence, &ldquo;on the day
      when you can place a date under these words.&rdquo; And he sprang away quickly
      to join Athos, who was returning with slow steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they re-entered the fort, the sea rose with that rapid, gusty vehemence
      which characterizes the Mediterranean; the ill-humor of the element became
      a tempest. Something shapeless, and tossed about violently by the waves,
      appeared just off the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Athos,&mdash;&ldquo;a wrecked boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not a boat,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;there is a bark gaining the port rapidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is a bark in the creek, which is prudently seeking shelter
      here; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all&mdash;it
      has run aground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the carriage, which I threw into the sea after landing the
      prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;if you take my advice, D&rsquo;Artagnan, you will burn that
      carriage, in order that no vestige of it may remain, without which the
      fishermen of Antibes, who have believed they had to do with the devil,
      will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your advice is good, Athos, and I will this night have it carried out, or
      rather, I will carry it out myself; but let us go in, for the rain falls
      heavily, and the lightning is terrific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D&rsquo;Artagnan
      had the key, they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the
      chamber inhabited by the prisoner. Upon a sign from D&rsquo;Artagnan, they
      concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see. Look. The prisoner is returning from chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they saw, by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog which
      the wind stamped upon the bank-ward sky, they saw pass gravely, at six
      paces behind the governor, a man clothed in black and masked by a vizor of
      polished steel, soldered to a helmet of the same nature, which altogether
      enveloped the whole of his head. The fire of the heavens cast red
      reflections on the polished surface, and these reflections, flying off
      capriciously, seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate,
      instead of imprecations. In the middle of the gallery, the prisoner
      stopped for a moment, to contemplate the infinite horizon, to respire the
      sulphurous perfumes of the tempest, to drink in thirstily the hot rain,
      and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, monsieur,&rdquo; said Saint-Mars, sharply, to the prisoner, for he
      already became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls.
      &ldquo;Monsieur, come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say monseigneur!&rdquo; cried Athos, from his corner, with a voice so solemn
      and terrible, that the governor trembled from head to foot. Athos insisted
      upon respect being paid to fallen majesty. The prisoner turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who spoke?&rdquo; asked Saint-Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, showing himself promptly. &ldquo;You know that
      is the order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me neither monsieur nor monseigneur,&rdquo; said the prisoner in his turn,
      in a voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul; &ldquo;call me ACCURSED!&rdquo;
       He passed on, and the iron door croaked after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes a truly unfortunate man!&rdquo; murmured the musketeer in a hollow
      whisper, pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIII. Promises.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scarcely had D&rsquo;Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends,
      when one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the governor
      was seeking him. The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea, and which
      appeared so eager to gain the port, came to Sainte-Marguerite with an
      important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers. On opening it,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan recognized the writing of the king: &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said
      Louis XIV., &ldquo;you will have completed the execution of my orders, Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Artagnan; return, then, immediately to Paris, and join me at the
      Louvre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the end of my exile!&rdquo; cried the musketeer with joy; &ldquo;God be
      praised, I am no longer a jailer!&rdquo; And he showed the letter to Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, you must leave us?&rdquo; replied the latter, in a melancholy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but to meet again, dear friend, seeing that Raoul is old enough now
      to go alone with M. de Beaufort, and will prefer his father going back in
      company with M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, to forcing him to travel two hundred leagues
      solitarily to reach home at La Fere; will you not, Raoul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; stammered the latter, with an expression of tender regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my friend,&rdquo; interrupted Athos, &ldquo;I will never quit Raoul till the
      day his vessel disappears on the horizon. As long as he remains in France
      he shall not be separated from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, dear friend; but we will, at least, leave
      Sainte-Marguerite together; take advantage of the bark that will convey me
      back to Antibes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart; we cannot too soon be at a distance from this fort,
      and from the spectacle that shocked us so just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three friends quitted the little isle, after paying their respects to
      the governor, and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they took
      their farewell of the white walls of the fort. D&rsquo;Artagnan parted from his
      friend that same night, after having seen fire set to the carriage upon
      the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars, according to the advice the captain
      had given him. Before getting on horseback, and after leaving the arms of
      Athos: &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you bear too much resemblance to two
      soldiers who are abandoning their post. Something warns me that Raoul will
      require being supported by you in his rank. Will you allow me to ask
      permission to go over into Africa with a hundred good muskets? The king
      will not refuse me, and I will take you with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; replied Raoul, pressing his hand with emotion,
      &ldquo;thanks for that offer, which would give us more than we wish, either
      monsieur le comte or I. I, who am young, stand in need of labor of mind
      and fatigue of body; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose. You
      are his best friend. I recommend him to your care. In watching over him,
      you are holding both our souls in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go; my horse is all in a fret,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, with whom the
      most manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas in
      conversation. &ldquo;Come, comte, how many days longer has Raoul to stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days at most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long will it take you to reach home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a considerable time,&rdquo; replied Athos. &ldquo;I shall not like the idea of
      being separated too quickly from Raoul. Time will travel too fast of
      itself to require me to aid it by distance. I shall only make
      half-stages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why so, my friend? Nothing is more dull than traveling slowly; and
      hostelry life does not become a man like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, I came hither on post-horses; but I wish to purchase two
      animals of a superior kind. Now, to take them home fresh, it would not be
      prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight leagues a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Grimaud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He arrived yesterday morning with Raoul&rsquo;s appointments; and I have left
      him to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, never to come back again,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan suffered to escape him.
      &ldquo;Till we meet again, then, dear Athos&mdash;and if you are diligent, I
      shall embrace you the sooner.&rdquo; So saying, he put his foot in the stirrup,
      which Raoul held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; said the young man, embracing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he got into his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      His horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends.
      This scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos, near the
      gates of Antibes, whither D&rsquo;Artagnan, after his supper, had ordered his
      horses to be brought. The road began to branch off there, white and
      undulating in the vapors of the night. The horse eagerly respired the
      salt, sharp perfume of the marshes. D&rsquo;Artagnan put him to a trot; and
      Athos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house. All at once they heard the
      rapid approach of a horse&rsquo;s steps, and first believed it to be one of
      those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in a
      road. But it was really the return of the horseman. They uttered a cry of
      joyous surprise; and the captain, springing to the ground like a young
      man, seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and Raoul. He
      held them long embraced thus, without speaking a word, or suffering the
      sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him. Then, as rapidly as he
      had come back, he set off again, with a sharp application of his spurs to
      the sides of his fiery horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the comte, in a low voice, &ldquo;alas! alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An evil omen!&rdquo; on his side, said D&rsquo;Artagnan to himself, making up for
      lost time. &ldquo;I could not smile upon them. An evil omen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Grimaud was on foot again. The service commanded by M. de
      Beaufort was happily accomplished. The flotilla, sent to Toulon by the
      exertions of Raoul, had set out, dragging after it in little nutshells,
      almost invisible, the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers put
      in requisition for the service of the fleet. The time, so short, which
      remained for father and son to live together, appeared to go by with
      double rapidity, like some swift stream that flows towards eternity. Athos
      and Raoul returned to Toulon, which began to be filled with the noise of
      carriages, with the noise of arms, the noise of neighing horses. The
      trumpeters sounded their spirited marches; the drummers signalized their
      strength; the streets were overflowing with soldiers, servants, and
      tradespeople. The Duc de Beaufort was everywhere, superintending the
      embarkation with the zeal and interest of a good captain. He encouraged
      the humblest of his companions; he scolded his lieutenants, even those of
      the highest rank. Artillery, provisions, baggage, he insisted upon seeing
      all himself. He examined the equipment of every soldier; assured himself
      of the health and soundness of every horse. It was plain that, light,
      boastful, egotistical, in his hotel, the gentleman became the soldier
      again&mdash;the high noble, a captain&mdash;in face of the responsibility
      he had accepted. And yet, it must be admitted that, whatever was the care
      with which he presided over the preparations for departure, it was easy to
      perceive careless precipitation, and the absence of all the precaution
      that make the French soldier the first soldier in the world, because, in
      that world, he is the one most abandoned to his own physical and moral
      resources. All things having satisfied, or appearing to have satisfied,
      the admiral, he paid his compliments to Raoul, and gave the last orders
      for sailing, which was ordered the next morning at daybreak. He invited
      the comte had his son to dine with him; but they, under a pretext of
      service, kept themselves apart. Gaining their hostelry, situated under the
      trees of the great Place, they took their repast in haste, and Athos led
      Raoul to the rocks which dominate the city, vast gray mountains, whence
      the view is infinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears, so
      remote is it, on a level with the rocks themselves. The night was fine, as
      it always is in these happy climes. The moon, rising behind the rocks,
      unrolled a silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea. In the
      roadsteads maneuvered silently the vessels which had just taken their rank
      to facilitate the embarkation. The sea, loaded with phosphoric light,
      opened beneath the hulls of the barks that transported the baggage and
      munitions; every dip of the prow plowed up this gulf of white flames; from
      every oar dropped liquid diamonds. The sailors, rejoicing in the largesses
      of the admiral, were heard murmuring their slow and artless songs.
      Sometimes the grinding of the chains was mixed with the dull noise of shot
      falling into the holds. Such harmonies, such a spectacle, oppress the
      heart like fear, and dilate it like hope. All this life speaks of death.
      Athos had seated himself with his son, upon the moss, among the brambles
      of the promontory. Around their heads passed and repassed large bats,
      carried along by the fearful whirl of their blind chase. The feet of Raoul
      were over the edge of the cliff, bathed in that void which is peopled by
      vertigo, and provokes to self-annihilation. When the moon had risen to its
      fullest height, caressing with light the neighboring peaks, when the
      watery mirror was illumined in its full extent, and the little red fires
      had made their openings in the black masses of every ship, Athos,
      collecting all his ideas and all his courage, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has made all these things that we see, Raoul; He has made us also,&mdash;poor
      atoms mixed up with this monstrous universe. We shine like those fires and
      those stars; we sigh like those waves; we suffer like those great ships,
      which are worn out in plowing the waves, in obeying the wind that urges
      them towards an end, as the breath of God blows us towards a port.
      Everything likes to live, Raoul; and everything seems beautiful to living
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;we have before us a beautiful spectacle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good D&rsquo;Artagnan is!&rdquo; interrupted Athos, suddenly, &ldquo;and what a rare
      good fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend as
      he is! That is what you have missed, Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend!&rdquo; cried Raoul, &ldquo;I have wanted a friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche is an agreeable companion,&rdquo; resumed the comte, coldly, &ldquo;but
      I believe, in the times in which you live, men are more engaged in their
      own interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours. You have
      sought a secluded life; that is a great happiness, but you have lost your
      strength thereby. We four, more weaned from those delicate abstractions
      that constitute your joy, furnished much more resistance when misfortune
      presented itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not interrupted you, monsieur, to tell you that I had a friend,
      and that that friend is M. de Guiche. <i>Certes</i>, he is good and
      generous, and moreover he loves me. But I have lived under the
      guardianship of another friendship, monsieur, as precious and as strong as
      that of which you speak, since it is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been a friend for you, Raoul,&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! monsieur, and in what respect not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have given you reason to think that life has but one face,
      because, sad and severe, alas! I have always cut off for you, without, God
      knows, wishing to do so, the joyous buds that spring incessantly from the
      fair tree of youth; so that at this moment I repent of not having made of
      you a more expansive, dissipated, animated man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why you say that, monsieur. No, it is not you who have made me
      what I am; it was love, which took me at the time when children only have
      inclinations; it is the constancy natural to my character, which with
      other creatures is but habit. I believed that I should always be as I was;
      I thought God had cast me in a path quite clear, quite straight, bordered
      with fruits and flowers. I had ever watching over me your vigilance and
      strength. I believed myself to be vigilant and strong. Nothing prepared
      me; I fell once, and that once deprived me of courage for the whole of my
      life. It is quite true that I wrecked myself. Oh, no, monsieur! you are
      nothing in my past but happiness&mdash;in my future but hope! No, I have
      no reproach to make against life such as you made it for me; I bless you,
      and I love you ardently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Raoul, your words do me good. They prove to me that you will act
      a little for me in the time to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall only act for you, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul, what I have never hitherto done with respect to you, I will
      henceforward do. I will be your friend, not your father. We will live in
      expanding ourselves, instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners,
      when you come back. And that will be soon, will it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, monsieur, for such an expedition cannot last long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon, then, Raoul, soon, instead of living moderately on my income, I
      will give you the capital of my estates. It will suffice for launching you
      into the world till my death; and you will give me, I hope, before that
      time, the consolation of not seeing my race extinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do all you may command,&rdquo; said Raoul, much agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary, Raoul, that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead
      you into too hazardous enterprises. You have gone through your ordeal; you
      are known to be a true man under fire. Remember that war with Arabs is a
      war of snares, ambuscades, and assassinations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is said, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade. It is a death which
      always implies a little rashness or want of foresight. Often, indeed, he
      who falls in one meets with but little pity. Those who are not pitied,
      Raoul, have died to little purpose. Still further, the conqueror laughs,
      and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our
      faults. Do you clearly understand what I am saying to you, Raoul? God
      forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am naturally prudent, monsieur, and I have very good fortune,&rdquo; said
      Raoul, with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; the
      young man hastened to add, &ldquo;in twenty combats through which I have been, I
      have only received one scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is in addition,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;the climate to be dreaded: that is an
      ugly end, to die of fever! King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an
      arrow or the plague, rather than the fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur! with sobriety, with reasonable exercise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his dispatches
      shall be sent off every fortnight to France. You, as his aide-de-camp,
      will be charged with expediting them, and will be sure not to forget me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; said Raoul, almost choked with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, Raoul, as you are a good Christian, and I am one also, we ought
      to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian angels.
      Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you, on any occasion,
      you will think of me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First and at once! Oh! yes, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will call upon me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dream of me sometimes, do you not, Raoul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every night, monsieur. During my early youth I saw you in my dreams, calm
      and mild, with one hand stretched out over my head, and that it was which
      made me sleep so soundly&mdash;formerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We love each other too dearly,&rdquo; said the comte, &ldquo;that from this moment,
      in which we separate, a portion of both our souls should not travel with
      one and the other of us, and should not dwell wherever we may dwell.
      Whenever you may be sad, Raoul, I feel that my heart will be dissolved in
      sadness; and when you smile on thinking of me, be assured you will send
      me, from however remote a distance, a vital scintillation of your joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not promise you to be joyous,&rdquo; replied the young man; &ldquo;but you may
      be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you, not one
      hour, I swear, unless I shall be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos could contain himself no longer; he threw his arm round the neck of
      his son, and held him embraced with all the power of his heart. The moon
      began to be now eclipsed by twilight; a golden band surrounded the
      horizon, announcing the approach of the day. Athos threw his cloak over
      the shoulders of Raoul, and led him back to the city, where burdens and
      porters were already in motion, like a vast ant-hill. At the extremity of
      the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting, they saw a dark
      shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards, as if in indecision or
      ashamed to be seen. It was Grimaud, who in his anxiety had tracked his
      master, and was there awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my good Grimaud,&rdquo; cried Raoul, &ldquo;what do you want? You are come to
      tell us it is time to be gone, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; said Grimaud, addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone of
      reproach, which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are right!&rdquo; cried the comte. &ldquo;No, Raoul shall not go alone; no,
      he shall not be left alone in a strange land without some friendly hand to
      support him, some friendly heart to recall to him all he loved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Grimaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, yes, you!&rdquo; cried Raoul, touched to the inmost heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;you are very old, my good Grimaud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; replied the latter, with an inexpressible depth of
      feeling and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the embarkation is begun,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;and you are not prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Grimaud, showing the keys of his trunks, mixed with those of
      his young master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; again objected Raoul, &ldquo;you cannot leave monsieur le comte thus
      alone; monsieur le comte, whom you have never quitted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud turned his diamond eyes upon Athos and Raoul, as if to measure the
      strength of both. The comte uttered not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le comte prefers my going,&rdquo; said Grimaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Athos, by an inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the drums suddenly rolled, and the clarions filled the air
      with their inspiring notes. The regiments destined for the expedition
      began to debouch from the city. They advanced to the number of five, each
      composed of forty companies. Royals marched first, distinguished by their
      white uniform, faced with blue. The <i>ordonnance</i> colors, quartered
      cross-wise, violet and dead leaf, with a sprinkling of golden <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>,
      left the white-colored flag, with its <i>fleur-de-lised</i> cross, to
      dominate the whole. Musketeers at the wings, with their forked sticks and
      their muskets on their shoulders; pikemen in the center, with their
      lances, fourteen feet in length, marched gayly towards the transports,
      which carried them in detail to the ships. The regiments of Picardy,
      Navarre, Normandy, and Royal Vaisseau, followed after. M. de Beaufort had
      known well how to select his troops. He himself was seen closing the march
      with his staff&mdash;it would take a full hour before he could reach the
      sea. Raoul with Athos turned his steps slowly towards the beach, in order
      to take his place when the prince embarked. Grimaud, boiling with the
      ardor of a young man, superintended the embarkation of Raoul&rsquo;s baggage in
      the admiral&rsquo;s vessel. Athos, with his arm passed through that of the son
      he was about to lose, absorbed in melancholy meditation, was deaf to every
      noise around him. An officer came quickly towards them to inform Raoul
      that M. de Beaufort was anxious to have him by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the kindness to tell the prince,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;that I request he
      will allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his general.
      Please to tell the prince, monsieur, that the vicomte will join him
      immediately.&rdquo; The officer set off at a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether we part here or part there,&rdquo; added the comte, &ldquo;it is no less a
      separation.&rdquo; He carefully brushed the dust from his son&rsquo;s coat, and passed
      his hand over his hair as they walked along. &ldquo;But, Raoul,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
      want money. M. de Beaufort&rsquo;s train will be splendid, and I am certain it
      will be agreeable to you to purchase horses and arms, which are very dear
      things in Africa. Now, as you are not actually in the service of the king
      or M. de Beaufort, and are simply a volunteer, you must not reckon upon
      either pay or largesse. But I should not like you to want for anything at
      Gigelli. Here are two hundred pistoles; if you would please me, Raoul,
      spend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul pressed the hand of his father, and, at the turning of a street,
      they saw M. de Beaufort, mounted on a magnificent white <i>genet</i>,
      which responded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the
      city. The duke called Raoul, and held out his hand to the comte. He spoke
      to him for some time, with such a kindly expression that the heart of the
      poor father even felt a little comforted. It was, however, evident to both
      father and son that their walk amounted to nothing less than a punishment.
      There was a terrible moment&mdash;that at which, on quitting the sands of
      the shore, the soldiers and sailors exchanged the last kisses with their
      families and friends; a supreme moment, in which, notwithstanding the
      clearness of the heavens, the warmth of the sun, of the perfumes of the
      air, and the rich life that was circulating in their veins, everything
      appeared black, everything bitter, everything created doubts of
      Providence, nay, at the most, of God. It was customary for the admiral and
      his suite to embark last; the cannon waited to announce, with its
      formidable voice, that the leader had placed his foot on board his vessel.
      Athos, forgetful of both the admiral and the fleet, and of his own dignity
      as a strong man, opened his arms to his son, and pressed him convulsively
      to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accompany us on board,&rdquo; said the duke, very much affected; &ldquo;you will gain
      a good half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;my farewell has been spoken, I do not wish to voice a
      second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, vicomte, embark&mdash;embark quickly!&rdquo; added the prince, wishing to
      spare the tears of these two men, whose hearts were bursting. And
      paternally, tenderly, very much as Porthos might have done, he took Raoul
      in his arms and placed him in the boat, the oars of which, at a signal,
      immediately were dipped in the waves. He himself, forgetful of ceremony,
      jumped into his boat, and pushed it off with a vigorous foot. &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo;
       cried Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos replied only by a sign, but he felt something burning on his hand:
      it was the respectful kiss of Grimaud&mdash;the last farewell of the
      faithful dog. This kiss given, Grimaud jumped from the step of the mole
      upon the stem of a two-oared yawl, which had just been taken in tow by a
      <i>chaland</i> served by twelve galley-oars. Athos seated himself on the
      mole, stunned, deaf, abandoned. Every instant took from him one of the
      features, one of the shades of the pale face of his son. With his arms
      hanging down, his eyes fixed, his mouth open, he remained confounded with
      Raoul&mdash;in one same look, in one same thought, in one same stupor. The
      sea, by degrees, carried away boats and faces to that distance at which
      men become nothing but points,&mdash;loves, nothing but remembrances.
      Athos saw his son ascend the ladder of the admiral&rsquo;s ship, he saw him lean
      upon the rail of the deck, and place himself in such a manner as to be
      always an object in the eye of his father. In vain the cannon thundered,
      in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult, responded to by
      immense acclamations from the shore; in vain did the noise deafen the ear
      of the father, the smoke obscured the cherished object of his aspirations.
      Raoul appeared to him to the last moment; and the imperceptible atom,
      passing from black to pale, from pale to white, from white to nothing,
      disappeared for Athos&mdash;disappeared very long after, to all the eyes
      of the spectators, had disappeared both gallant ships and swelling sails.
      Towards midday, when the sun devoured space, and scarcely the tops of the
      masts dominated the incandescent limit of the sea, Athos perceived a soft
      aerial shadow rise, and vanish as soon as seen. This was the smoke of a
      cannon, which M. de Beaufort ordered to be fired as a last salute to the
      coast of France. The point was buried in its turn beneath the sky, and
      Athos returned with slow and painful step to his deserted hostelry.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIV. Among Women.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had not been able to hide his feelings from his friends so much
      as he would have wished. The stoical soldier, the impassive man-at-arms,
      overcome by fear and sad presentiments, had yielded, for a few moments, to
      human weakness. When, therefore, he had silenced his heart and calmed the
      agitation of his nerves, turning towards his lackey, a silent servant,
      always listening, in order to obey the more promptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rabaud,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;mind, we must travel thirty leagues a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your pleasure, captain,&rdquo; replied Rabaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from that moment, D&rsquo;Artagnan, accommodating his action to the pace of
      the horse, like a true centaur, gave up his thoughts to nothing&mdash;that
      is to say, to everything. He asked himself why the king had sent for him
      back; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at the feet of Raoul.
      As to the first subject, the reply was negative; he knew right well that
      the king&rsquo;s calling him was from necessity. He still further knew that
      Louis XIV. must experience an imperious desire for a private conversation
      with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a level with the
      highest powers of the kingdom. But as to saying exactly what the king&rsquo;s
      wish was, D&rsquo;Artagnan found himself completely at a loss. The musketeer had
      no doubts, either, upon the reason which had urged the unfortunate
      Philippe to reveal his character and birth. Philippe, buried forever
      beneath a mask of steel, exiled to a country where the men seemed little
      more than slaves of the elements; Philippe, deprived even of the society
      of D&rsquo;Artagnan, who had loaded him with honors and delicate attentions, had
      nothing more to see than odious specters in this world, and, despair
      beginning to devour him, he poured himself forth in complaints, in the
      belief that his revelations would raise up some avenger for him. The
      manner in which the musketeer had been near killing his two best friends,
      the destiny which had so strangely brought Athos to participate in the
      great state secret, the farewell of Raoul, the obscurity of the future
      which threatened to end in a melancholy death; all this threw D&rsquo;Artagnan
      incessantly back on lamentable predictions and forebodings, which the
      rapidity of his pace did not dissipate, as it used formerly to do.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan passed from these considerations to the remembrance of the
      proscribed Porthos and Aramis. He saw them both, fugitives, tracked,
      ruined&mdash;laborious architects of fortunes they had lost; and as the
      king called for his man of execution in hours of vengeance and malice,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan trembled at the very idea of receiving some commission that
      would make his very soul bleed. Sometimes, ascending hills, when the
      winded horse breathed hard from his red nostrils, and heaved his flanks,
      the captain, left to more freedom of thought, reflected on the prodigious
      genius of Aramis, a genius of acumen and intrigue, a match to which the
      Fronde and the civil war had produced but twice. Soldier, priest,
      diplomatist; gallant, avaricious, cunning; Aramis had never taken the good
      things of this life except as stepping-stones to rise to giddier ends.
      Generous in spirit, if not lofty in heart, he never did ill but for the
      sake of shining even yet more brilliantly. Towards the end of his career,
      at the moment of reaching the goal, like the patrician Fuscus, he had made
      a false step upon a plank, and had fallen into the sea. But Porthos, good,
      harmless Porthos! To see Porthos hungry, to see Mousqueton without gold
      lace, imprisoned, perhaps; to see Pierrefonds, Bracieux, razed to the very
      stones, dishonored even to the timber,&mdash;these were so many poignant
      griefs for D&rsquo;Artagnan, and every time that one of these griefs struck him,
      he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly beneath the vaults of
      foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the burning sun. Never was
      the man of spirit subjected to <i>ennui</i>, if his body was exposed to
      fatigue; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life light, if he
      had something to engage his mind. D&rsquo;Artagnan, riding fast, thinking as
      constantly, alighted from his horse in Pairs, fresh and tender in his
      muscles as the athlete preparing for the gymnasium. The king did not
      expect him so soon, and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, instead of riding after the king, as he would formerly have
      done, took off his boots, had a bath, and waited till his majesty should
      return dusty and tired. He occupied the interval of five hours in taking,
      as people say, the air of the house, and in arming himself against all ill
      chances. He learned that the king, during the last fortnight, had been
      gloomy; that the queen-mother was ill and much depressed; that Monsieur,
      the king&rsquo;s brother, was exhibiting a devotional turn; that Madame had the
      vapors; and that M. de Guiche was gone to one of his estates. He learned
      that M. Colbert was radiant; that M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician
      every day, who still did not cure him, and that his principal complaint
      was one which physicians do not usually cure, unless they are political
      physicians. The king, D&rsquo;Artagnan was told, behaved in the kindest manner
      to M. Fouquet, and did not allow him to be ever out of his sight; but the
      surintendant, touched to the heart, like one of those fine trees a worm
      has punctured, was declining daily, in spite of the royal smile, that sun
      of court trees. D&rsquo;Artagnan learned that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had
      become indispensable to the king; that the king, during his sporting
      excursions, if he did not take her with him, wrote to her frequently, no
      longer verses, but, which was much worse, prose, and that whole pages at a
      time. Thus, as the political Pleiad of the day said, the <i>first king in
      the world</i> was seen descending from his horse <i>with an ardor beyond
      compare</i>, and on the crown of his hat scrawling bombastic phrases,
      which M. de Saint-Aignan, aide-de-camp in perpetuity, carried to La
      Valliere at the risk of foundering his horses. During this time, deer and
      pheasants were left to the free enjoyment of their nature, hunted so
      lazily that, it was said, the art of venery ran great risk of degenerating
      at the court of France. D&rsquo;Artagnan then thought of the wishes of poor
      Raoul, of that desponding letter destined for a woman who passed her life
      in hoping, and as D&rsquo;Artagnan loved to philosophize a little occasionally,
      he resolved to profit by the absence of the king to have a minute&rsquo;s talk
      with Mademoiselle de la Valliere. This was a very easy affair; while the
      king was hunting, Louise was walking with some other ladies in one of the
      galleries of the Palais Royal, exactly where the captain of the musketeers
      had some guards to inspect. D&rsquo;Artagnan did not doubt that, if he could but
      open the conversation on Raoul, Louise might give him grounds for writing
      a consolatory letter to the poor exile; and hope, or at least consolation
      for Raoul, in the state of heart in which he had left him, was the sun,
      was life to two men, who were very dear to our captain. He directed his
      course, therefore, to the spot where he knew he should find Mademoiselle
      de la Valliere. D&rsquo;Artagnan found La Valliere the center of the circle. In
      her apparent solitude, the king&rsquo;s favorite received, like a queen, more,
      perhaps, than the queen, a homage of which Madame had been so proud, when
      all the king&rsquo;s looks were directed to her and commanded the looks of the
      courtiers. D&rsquo;Artagnan, although no squire of dames, received,
      nevertheless, civilities and attentions from the ladies; he was polite, as
      a brave man always is, and his terrible reputation had conciliated as much
      friendship among the men as admiration among the women. On seeing him
      enter, therefore, they immediately accosted him; and, as is not
      unfrequently the case with fair ladies, opened the attack by questions.
      &ldquo;Where <i>had</i> he been? What <i>had</i> become of him so long? Why had
      they not seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful
      style, to the delight and astonishment of the curious from the king&rsquo;s
      balcony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied that he had just come from the land of oranges. This set all
      the ladies laughing. Those were times in which everybody traveled, but in
      which, notwithstanding, a journey of a hundred leagues was a problem often
      solved by death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the land of oranges?&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente. &ldquo;From
      Spain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! eh!&rdquo; said the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Malta?&rdquo; echoed Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> You are coming very near, ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it an island?&rdquo; asked La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;I will not give you the trouble of
      seeking any further; I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is, at
      this moment, embarking for Algiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen the army?&rdquo; asked several warlike fair ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As plainly as I see you,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fleet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we any of us any friends there?&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente, coldly, but in a manner to attract attention to a
      question that was not without its calculated aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;yes; there were M. de la Guillotiere, M. de
      Manchy, M. de Bragelonne&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere became pale. &ldquo;M. de Bragelonne!&rdquo; cried the perfidious
      Athenais. &ldquo;Eh, what!&mdash;is he gone to the wars?&mdash;he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais trod on her toe, but all in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what my opinion is?&rdquo; continued she, addressing D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mademoiselle; but I should like very much to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is, then, that all the men who go to this war are desperate,
      desponding men, whom love has treated ill; and who go to try if they
      cannot find jet-complexioned women more kind than fair ones have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the ladies laughed; La Valliere was evidently confused; Montalais
      coughed loud enough to waken the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you are in error when you speak
      of black women at Gigelli; the women there have not jet faces; it is true
      they are not white&mdash;they are yellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yellow!&rdquo; exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! do not disparage it. I have never seen a finer color to match with
      black eyes and a coral mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for M. de Bragelonne,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente, with persistent malice. &ldquo;He will make amends for his
      loss. Poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence followed these words; and D&rsquo;Artagnan had time to
      observe and reflect that women&mdash;mild doves&mdash;treat each other
      more cruelly than tigers. But making La Valliere pale did not satisfy
      Athenais; she determined to make her blush likewise. Resuming the
      conversation without pause, &ldquo;Do you know, Louise,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that there
      is a great sin on your conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sin, mademoiselle?&rdquo; stammered the unfortunate girl, looking round
      her for support, without finding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&mdash;why,&rdquo; continued Athenais, &ldquo;the poor young man was affianced to
      you; he loved you; you cast him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a right which every honest woman has,&rdquo; said Montalais, in
      an affected tone. &ldquo;When we know we cannot constitute the happiness of a
      man, it is much better to cast him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast him off! or refuse him!&mdash;that&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Athenais,
      &ldquo;but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Valliere has to reproach
      herself with. The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars; and
      to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with.&rdquo; Louise pressed
      her hand over her icy brow. &ldquo;And if he dies,&rdquo; continued her pitiless
      tormentor, &ldquo;you will have killed him. That is the sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise, half-dead, caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers,
      whose face betrayed unusual emotion. &ldquo;You wished to speak with me,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said she, in a voice broken by anger and pain. &ldquo;What
      had you to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made several steps along the gallery, holding Louise on his
      arm; then, when they were far enough removed from the others&mdash;&ldquo;What I
      had to say to you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente has just expressed; roughly and unkindly, it is true but
      still in its entirety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a faint cry; pierced to the heart by this new wound, she went
      her way, like one of those poor birds which, struck unto death, seek the
      shade of the thicket in which to die. She disappeared at one door, at the
      moment the king was entering by another. The first glance of the king was
      directed towards the empty seat of his mistress. Not perceiving La
      Valliere, a frown came over his brow; but as soon as he saw D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      who bowed to him&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! monsieur!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;you <i>have</i> been
      diligent! I am much pleased with you.&rdquo; This was the superlative expression
      of royal satisfaction. Many men would have been ready to lay down their
      lives for such a speech from the king. The maids of honor and the
      courtiers, who had formed a respectful circle round the king on his
      entrance, drew back, on observing he wished to speak privately with his
      captain of the musketeers. The king led the way out of the gallery, after
      having again, with his eyes, sought everywhere for La Valliere, whose
      absence he could not account for. The moment they were out of the reach of
      curious ears, &ldquo;Well! Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is in his prison, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say on the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a moment at which the fisherman&mdash;who took me in his boat
      to Sainte-Marguerite&mdash;revolted, and did his best to kill me. The&mdash;the
      prisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king became pale. &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; said he; and D&rsquo;Artagnan bowed. Louis
      walked about his cabinet with hasty steps. &ldquo;Were you at Antibes,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;when Monsieur de Beaufort came there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire; I was setting off when monsieur le duc arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; which was followed by a fresh silence. &ldquo;Whom did you see there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many persons,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king perceived he was unwilling to speak. &ldquo;I have sent for you,
      monsieur le capitaine, to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at
      Nantes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Nantes!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Bretagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, it is in Bretagne. Will you majesty make so long a journey as
      to Nantes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The States are assembled there,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;I have two demands to
      make of them: I wish to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I set out?&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow evening; for you must stand
      in need of rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have rested, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. Then between this and to-morrow evening, when you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave; but, perceiving the king very
      much embarrassed, &ldquo;Will you majesty,&rdquo; said he, stepping two paces forward,
      &ldquo;take the court with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you majesty will, doubtless, want the musketeers?&rdquo; And the eye of
      the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a brigade of them,&rdquo; replied Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all? Has your majesty no other orders to give me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;ah&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all attention, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the castle of Nantes, which I hear is very ill arranged, you will
      adopt the practice of placing musketeers at the door of each of the
      principal dignitaries I shall take with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the principal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance, at the door of M. de Lyonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that of M. Letellier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of M. de Brienne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of monsieur le surintendant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sire. By to-morrow I shall have set out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; but one more word, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan. At Nantes you will meet
      with M. le Duc de Gesvres, captain of the guards. Be sure that your
      musketeers are placed before his guards arrive. Precedence always belongs
      to the first comer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if M. de Gesvres should question you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question me, sire! Is it likely that M. de Gesvres should question me?&rdquo;
       And the musketeer, turning cavalierly on his heel, disappeared. &ldquo;To
      Nantes!&rdquo; said he to himself, as he descended from the stairs. &ldquo;Why did he
      not dare to say, from thence to Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he reached the great gates, one of M. Brienne&rsquo;s clerks came running
      after him, exclaiming, &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan! I beg your pardon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Monsieur Ariste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has desired me to give you this order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon your cash-box?&rdquo; asked the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur; on that of M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was surprised, but he took the order, which was in the king&rsquo;s
      own writing, and was for two hundred pistoles. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; thought he, after
      having politely thanked M. Brienne&rsquo;s clerk, &ldquo;M. Fouquet is to pay for the
      journey, then! <i>Mordioux!</i> that is a bit of pure Louis XI. Why was
      not this order on the chest of M. Colbert? He would have paid it with such
      joy.&rdquo; And D&rsquo;Artagnan, faithful to his principle of never letting an order
      at sight get cold, went straight to the house of M. Fouquet, to receive
      his two hundred pistoles.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXV. The Last Supper.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching
      departure, for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends. From the
      bottom to the top of the house, the hurry of the servants bearing dishes,
      and the diligence of the <i>registres</i>, denoted an approaching change
      in offices and kitchen. D&rsquo;Artagnan, with his order in his hand, presented
      himself at the offices, when he was told it was too late to pay cash, the
      chest was closed. He only replied: &ldquo;On the king&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, a little put out by the serious air of the captain, replied,
      that &ldquo;that was a very respectable reason, but that the customs of the
      house were respectable likewise; and that, in consequence, he begged the
      bearer to call again next day.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan asked if he could not see M.
      Fouquet. The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere with
      such details, and rudely closed the outer door in the captain&rsquo;s face. But
      the latter had foreseen this stroke, and placed his boot between the door
      and the door-case, so that the lock did not catch, and the clerk was still
      nose to nose with his interlocutor. This made him change his tone, and
      say, with terrified politeness, &ldquo;If monsieur wishes to speak to M. le
      surintendant, he must go to the ante-chambers; these are the offices,
      where monseigneur never comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well! Where are they?&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the other side of the court,&rdquo; said the clerk, delighted to be free.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan crossed the court, and fell in with a crowd of servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour,&rdquo; he was answered by a fellow
      carrying a vermeil dish, in which were three pheasants and twelve quails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said the captain, laying hold of the servant by the end of his
      dish, &ldquo;that I am M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, captain of his majesty&rsquo;s musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow uttered a cry of surprise, and disappeared; D&rsquo;Artagnan
      following him slowly. He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in the
      ante-chamber: the latter, a little pale, came hastily out of the
      dining-room to learn what was the matter. D&rsquo;Artagnan smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing unpleasant, Monsieur Pelisson; only a little order to
      receive the money for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Fouquet&rsquo;s friend, breathing more freely; and he took the
      captain by the hand, and, dragging him behind him, led him into the
      dining-room, where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant, placed
      in the center, and buried in the cushions of a <i>fauteuil</i>. There were
      assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the honors of
      the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet. Joyous friends, for the
      most part faithful, they had not fled their protector at the approach of
      the storm, and, in spite of the threatening heavens, in spite of the
      trembling earth, they remained there, smiling, cheerful, as devoted in
      misfortune as they had been in prosperity. On the left of the surintendant
      sat Madame de Belliere; on his right was Madame Fouquet; as if braving the
      laws of the world, and putting all vulgar reasons of propriety to silence,
      the two protecting angels of this man united to offer, at the moment of
      the crisis, the support of their twined arms. Madame de Belliere was pale,
      trembling, and full of respectful attentions for madame la surintendante,
      who, with one hand on her husband&rsquo;s, was looking anxiously towards the
      door by which Pelisson had gone out to bring D&rsquo;Artagnan. The captain
      entered at first full of courtesy, and afterwards of admiration, when,
      with his infallible glance, he had divined as well as taken in the
      expression of every face. Fouquet raised himself up in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I did not myself receive
      you when coming in the king&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; And he pronounced the last words with
      a sort of melancholy firmness, which filled the hearts of all his friends
      with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I only come to you in the king&rsquo;s name
      to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet, which still
      remained overcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know whither I am setting out, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Madame Fouquet, recovered from her fright, &ldquo;you are not going
      so soon, monsieur le capitaine, as not to do us the honor to take a seat
      with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I should esteem that a great honor done me, but I am so pressed
      for time, that, you see, I have been obliged to permit myself to interrupt
      your repast to procure payment of my note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reply to which shall be gold,&rdquo; said Fouquet, making a sign to his
      intendant, who went out with the order D&rsquo;Artagnan handed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;I was not uneasy about the payment; the house is
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo; asked Madame de Belliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel your attack coming on?&rdquo; asked Madame Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, thank you both,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your attack?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, in his turn; &ldquo;are you unwell,
      monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a tertian fever, which seized me after the <i>fete</i> at Vaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; nothing but agitation, that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king,&rdquo; said La
      Fontaine, quietly, without suspicion that he was uttering a sacrilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot devote too much heart to the reception of our king,&rdquo; said
      Fouquet, mildly, to his poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan, with
      perfect frankness and much amenity. &ldquo;The fact is, monseigneur, that
      hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet
      had conducted himself well towards the king, the king had hardly done the
      like to the minister. But D&rsquo;Artagnan knew the terrible secret. He alone
      with Fouquet knew it; those two men had not, the one the courage to
      complain, the other the right to accuse. The captain, to whom the two
      hundred pistoles were brought, was about to take his leave, when Fouquet,
      rising, took a glass of wine, and ordered one to be given to D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the health of the king, <i>whatever may happen</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to your health, monseigneur, <i>whatever may happen</i>,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, with these words of evil omen, to all the company, who rose as
      soon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, for a moment, thought it was I and not my money he wanted,&rdquo; said
      Fouquet, endeavoring to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried his friends; &ldquo;and what for, in the name of Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not deceive yourselves, my dear brothers in Epicurus,&rdquo; said the
      superintendent; &ldquo;I do not wish to make a comparison between the most
      humble sinner on the earth, and the God we adore, but remember, he gave
      one day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper, and which
      was nothing but a farewell dinner, like that which we are making at this
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table. &ldquo;Shut the
      doors,&rdquo; said Fouquet, and the servants disappeared. &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo;
       continued Fouquet, lowering his voice, &ldquo;what was I formerly? What am I
      now? Consult among yourselves and reply. A man like me sinks when he does
      not continue to rise. What shall we say, then, when he really sinks? I
      have no more money, no more credit; I have no longer anything but powerful
      enemies, and powerless friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried Pelisson. &ldquo;Since you explain yourself with such frankness,
      it is our duty to be frank, likewise. Yes, you are ruined&mdash;yes, you
      are hastening to your ruin&mdash;stop. And, in the first place, what money
      have we left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven hundred thousand livres,&rdquo; said the intendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bread,&rdquo; murmured Madame Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relays,&rdquo; said Pelisson, &ldquo;relays, and fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Switzerland&mdash;to Savoy&mdash;but fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If monseigneur flies,&rdquo; said Madame Belliere, &ldquo;it will be said that he was
      guilty&mdash;was afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that, it will be said that I have carried away twenty millions
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will draw up memoirs to justify you,&rdquo; said La Fontaine. &ldquo;Fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will remain,&rdquo; said Fouquet. &ldquo;And, besides, does not everything serve
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have Belle-Isle,&rdquo; cried the Abbe Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am naturally going there, when going to Nantes,&rdquo; replied the
      superintendent. &ldquo;Patience, then, patience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before arriving at Nantes, what a distance!&rdquo; said Madame Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that well,&rdquo; replied Fouquet. &ldquo;But what is to be done there?
      The king summons me to the States. I know well it is for the purpose of
      ruining me; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have discovered the means of reconciling everything,&rdquo; cried
      Pelisson. &ldquo;You are going to set out for Nantes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet looked at him with an air of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with friends; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans; in your own
      barge as far as Nantes; always ready to defend yourself, if you are
      attacked; to escape, if you are threatened. In fact, you will carry your
      money against all chances; and, whilst flying, you will only have obeyed
      the king; then, reaching the sea, when you like, you will embark for
      Belle-Isle, and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may please
      you, like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven from its
      eyrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general assent followed Pelisson&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Yes, do so,&rdquo; said Madame
      Fouquet to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said Madame de Belliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it! do it!&rdquo; cried all his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of another
      fortune,&rdquo; said the Abbe Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, if necessary, we will go and discover a new world,&rdquo; added La
      Fontaine, intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope. &ldquo;A courier
      from the king,&rdquo; said the master of the ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence immediately ensued, as if the message brought by this
      courier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a
      moment before. Every one waited to see what the master would do. His brow
      was streaming with perspiration, and he was really suffering from his
      fever at that instant. He passed into his cabinet, to receive the king&rsquo;s
      message. There prevailed, as we have said, such a silence in the chambers,
      and throughout the attendance, that from the dining-room could be heard
      the voice of Fouquet, saying, &ldquo;That is well, monsieur.&rdquo; This voice was,
      however, broken by fatigue, and trembled with emotion. An instant after,
      Fouquet called Gourville, who crossed the gallery amidst the universal
      expectation. At length, he himself re-appeared among his guests; but it
      was no longer the same pale, spiritless countenance they had beheld when
      he left them; from pale he had become livid; and from spiritless,
      annihilated. A breathing, living specter, he advanced with his arms
      stretched out, his mouth parched, like a shade that comes to salute the
      friends of former days. On seeing him thus, every one cried out, and every
      one rushed towards Fouquet. The latter, looking at Pelisson, leaned upon
      his wife, and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise de Belliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, in a voice which had nothing human in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened, my God!&rdquo; said some one to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet opened his right hand, which was clenched, but glistening with
      perspiration, and displayed a paper, upon which Pelisson cast a terrified
      glance. He read the following lines, written by the king&rsquo;s hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET,&mdash;Give us, upon that which
      you have left of ours, the sum of seven hundred thousand livres, of which
      we stand in need to prepare for our departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And, as we know your health is not good, we pray God to restore you, and
      to have you in His holy keeping. &ldquo;&lsquo;LOUIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The present letter is to serve as a receipt.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of terror circulated through the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Pelisson, in his turn, &ldquo;you have received that letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Received it, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, since I have received it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have received it, Pelisson, I have paid it,&rdquo; said the surintendant,
      with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have paid it!&rdquo; cried Madame Fouquet. &ldquo;Then we are ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, no useless words,&rdquo; interrupted Pelisson. &ldquo;Next to money, life.
      Monseigneur, to horse! to horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, leave us!&rdquo; at once cried both the women, wild with grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! monseigneur, in saving yourself, you save us all. To horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he cannot hold himself on. Look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if he takes time to reflect&mdash;&rdquo; said the intrepid Pelisson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; murmured Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur! Monseigneur!&rdquo; cried Gourville, rushing up the stairs, four
      steps at once. &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I escorted, as you desired, the king&rsquo;s courier with the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! when I arrived at the Palais Royal, I saw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take breath, my poor friend, take breath; you are suffocating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; cried the impatient friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback,&rdquo; said Gourville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, then!&rdquo; cried every voice at once; &ldquo;there, then! is there an
      instant to be lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Fouquet rushed downstairs, calling for her horses; Madame de
      Belliere flew after her, catching her in her arms, and saying: &ldquo;Madame, in
      the name of his safety, do not betray anything, do not manifest alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pelisson ran to have the horses put to the carriages. And, in the
      meantime, Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping friends were
      able to throw into it of gold and silver&mdash;the last offering, the
      pious alms made to misery by poverty. The surintendant, dragged along by
      some, carried by others, was shut up in his carriage. Gourville took the
      reins, and mounted the box. Pelisson supported Madame Fouquet, who had
      fainted. Madame de Belliere had more strength, and was well paid for it;
      she received Fouquet&rsquo;s last kiss. Pelisson easily explained this
      precipitate departure by saying that an order from the king had summoned
      the minister to Nantes.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVI. In M. Colbert&rsquo;s Carriage.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Gourville had seen, the king&rsquo;s musketeers were mounting and following
      their captain. The latter, who did not like to be confined in his
      proceedings, left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant, and set
      off on post horses, recommending his men to use all diligence. However
      rapidly they might travel, they could not arrive before him. He had time,
      in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs, to see something which
      afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture. He saw M. Colbert
      coming out from his house to get into his carriage, which was stationed
      before the door. In this carriage D&rsquo;Artagnan perceived the hoods of two
      women, and being rather curious, he wished to know the names of the ladies
      hid beneath these hoods. To get a glimpse at them, for they kept
      themselves closely covered up, he urged his horse so near the carriage,
      that he drove him against the step with such force as to shake everything
      containing and contained. The terrified women uttered, the one a faint
      cry, by which D&rsquo;Artagnan recognized a young woman, the other an
      imprecation, in which he recognized the vigor and <i>aplomb</i> that half
      a century bestows. The hoods were thrown back: one of the women was Madame
      Vanel, the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse. D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s eyes were quicker
      than those of the ladies; he had seen and known them, whilst they did not
      recognize him; and as they laughed at their fright, pressing each other&rsquo;s
      hands,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to
      friendship than formerly. <i>She</i> paying her court to the mistress of
      M. Colbert! Poor M. Fouquet! that presages you nothing good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rode on. M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio
      commenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes.
      Madame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband&rsquo;s house, and,
      left alone with M. Colbert, chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her
      ride. She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation, that dear duchesse,
      and as she always talked for the ill of others, though ever with a view to
      her own good, her conversation amused her interlocutor, and did not fail
      to leave a favorable impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      She taught Colbert, who, poor man! was ignorant of the fact, how great a
      minister he was, and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher. She promised
      to rally around him, when he should become surintendant, all the old
      nobility of the kingdom, and questioned him as to the preponderance it
      would be proper to allow La Valliere. She praised him, she blamed him, she
      bewildered him. She showed him the secret of so many secrets that, for a
      moment, Colbert thought he was doing business with the devil. She proved
      to him that she held in her hand the Colbert of to-day, as she had held
      the Fouquet of yesterday; and as he asked her very simply the reason of
      her hatred for the surintendant: &ldquo;Why do you yourself hate him?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, in politics,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;the differences of system oft bring
      about dissentions between men. M. Fouquet always appeared to me to
      practice a system opposed to the true interests of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him.&mdash;&ldquo;I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet.
      The journey the king is about to take to Nantes will give a good account
      of him. M. Fouquet, for me, is a man gone by&mdash;and for you also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert made no reply. &ldquo;On his return from Nantes,&rdquo; continued the
      duchesse, &ldquo;the king, who is only anxious for a pretext, will find that the
      States have not behaved well&mdash;that they have made too few sacrifices.
      The States will say that the imposts are too heavy, and that the
      surintendant has ruined them. The king will lay all the blame on M.
      Fouquet, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he will be disgraced. Is not that your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert darted a glance at the duchesse, which plainly said: &ldquo;If M.
      Fouquet be only disgraced, you will not be the cause of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your place, M. Colbert,&rdquo; the duchesse hastened to say, &ldquo;must be a high
      place. Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself, after the
      fall of M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i> understand. To what does your ambition aspire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was useless, then, to overthrow the superintendent, Monsieur Colbert.
      It was idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the honor to tell you, madame&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I know, all about the interest of the king&mdash;but, if you
      please, we will speak of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine! that is to say, the affairs of his majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short, are you, or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet? Answer
      without evasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I ruin nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am endeavoring to comprehend, then, why you purchased from me the
      letters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet. Neither can I conceive why
      you have laid those letters before the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert, half stupefied, looked at the duchesse with an air of constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can less easily conceive how you, who received the
      money, can reproach me on that head&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is,&rdquo; said the old duchesse, &ldquo;because we must will that which we wish
      for, unless we are not able to obtain what we wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Will!</i>&rdquo; said Colbert, quite confounded by such coarse logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not able, <i>hein!</i> Speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not able, I allow, to destroy certain influences near the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fight in favor of M. Fouquet? What are they? Stop, let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very little influence; no knowledge of business, and small means. M.
      Fouquet has paid his court to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still another influence, what do you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it considerable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen-mother, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her majesty, the queen-mother, has a weakness for M. Fouquet very
      prejudicial to her son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never believe that,&rdquo; said the old duchesse, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Colbert, with incredulity, &ldquo;I have often experienced it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Formerly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very recently, madame, at Vaux. It was she who prevented the king from
      having M. Fouquet arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People do not forever entertain the same opinions, my dear monsieur. That
      which the queen may have wished recently, she would not wish, perhaps,
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said Colbert, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the reason is of very little consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I think it is of great consequence; for, if I were
      certain of not displeasing her majesty, the queen-mother, my scruples
      would be all removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! have you never heard talk of a certain secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it what you like. In short, the queen-mother has conceived a bitter
      hatred for all those who have participated, in one fashion or another, in
      the discovery of this secret, and M. Fouquet I believe is one of these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Colbert, &ldquo;we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just left her majesty, and she assures me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, then, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is something further; do you happen to know a man who was the
      intimate friend of M. Fouquet, M. d&rsquo;Herblay, a bishop, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bishop of Vannes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! this M. d&rsquo;Herblay, who also knew the secret, the queen-mother is
      pursuing with the utmost rancor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So hotly pursued, that if he were dead, she would not be satisfied with
      anything less than his head, to satisfy her he would never speak again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that the desire of the queen-mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An order is given for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay shall be sought for, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is well known where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert looked at the duchesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say where, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the residence of M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the residence of M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now the duchesse&rsquo;s turn to smile. &ldquo;Do not fancy the capture so
      easy,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;do not promise it so lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because M. d&rsquo;Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when and
      where you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a rebel, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Monsieur Colbert, we have passed all our lives in making rebels, and
      yet you see plainly, that so far from being taken, we take others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which no
      words can convey the expression, accompanied by a firmness not altogether
      wanting in grandeur. &ldquo;The times are gone,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in which subjects
      gained duchies by making war against the king of France. If M. d&rsquo;Herblay
      conspires, he will perish on the scaffold. That will give, or will not
      give, pleasure to his enemies,&mdash;a matter, by the way, of little
      importance to <i>us</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this <i>us</i>, a strange word in the mouth of Colbert, made the
      duchesse thoughtful for a moment. She caught herself reckoning inwardly
      with this man&mdash;Colbert had regained his superiority in the
      conversation, and he meant to keep it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me, madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have this M. d&rsquo;Herblay arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;I ask you nothing of the kind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you did, madame. But as I have been mistaken, we will leave him
      alone; the king has said nothing about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchesse bit her nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continued Colbert, &ldquo;what a poor capture would this bishop be! A
      bishop game for a king! Oh! no, no; I will not even take the slightest
      notice of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Game for a woman!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Is not the queen a woman? If she wishes M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay arrested, she has her reasons. Besides, is not M. d&rsquo;Herblay the
      friend of him who is doomed to fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! never mind that,&rdquo; said Colbert. &ldquo;This man shall be spared, if he is
      not the enemy of the king. Is that displeasing to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you wish to see him in prison, in the Bastile, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile than
      behind those of Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to the king about it; he will clear up the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whilst waiting for that enlightenment, Monsieur l&rsquo;Eveque de Vannes
      will have escaped. I would do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escaped! he! and whither should he escape? Europe is ours, in will, if
      not in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will always find an asylum, monsieur. It is evident you know nothing
      of the man you have to do with. You do not know D&rsquo;Herblay; you do not know
      Aramis. He was one of those four musketeers who, under the late king, made
      Cardinal de Richelieu tremble, and who, during the regency, gave so much
      trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has one, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A kingdom, he! what, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat to you, monsieur, that if he wants a kingdom, he either has it
      or will have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape, madame, I
      promise you he shall not escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belle-Isle is fortified, M. Colbert, and fortified by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Belle-Isle were also defended by him, Belle-Isle is not impregnable;
      and if Monsieur l&rsquo;Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle, well, madame,
      the place shall be besieged, and he will be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be very certain, monsieur, that the zeal you display in the
      interest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily, and you
      will be magnificently rewarded; but what shall I tell her of your projects
      respecting this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That when once taken, he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her
      secret shall never escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Monsieur Colbert, and we may say, that, dating from this
      instant, we have formed a solid alliance, that is, you and I, and that I
      am absolutely at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, madame, who place myself at yours. This Chevalier d&rsquo;Herblay is a
      kind of Spanish spy, is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret ambassador?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Higher still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop&mdash;King Phillip III. of Spain is a bigot. He is, perhaps, the
      confessor of Phillip III.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go higher even than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordieu!</i>&rdquo; cried Colbert, who forgot himself so far as to swear in
      the presence of this great lady, of this old friend of the queen-mother.
      &ldquo;He must then be the general of the Jesuits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you have guessed it at last,&rdquo; replied the duchesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then, madame, this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him; and we
      must make haste, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was my opinion, monsieur, but I did not dare to give it you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne, and not us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mark this well, M. Colbert. M. d&rsquo;Herblay is never discouraged; if he
      has missed one blow, he will be sure to make another; he will begin again.
      If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for himself,
      sooner or later, he will make another, of whom, to a certainty, you will
      not be prime minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression. &ldquo;I feel assured that
      a prison will settle this affair for us, madame, in a manner satisfactory
      for both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchesse smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you knew,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how many times Aramis has got out of
      prison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Colbert, &ldquo;we will take care that he shall not get out <i>this</i>
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were not attending to what I said to you just now. Do you
      remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so
      dreaded? And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession of
      that which they have now&mdash;money and experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert bit his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will renounce the idea of the prison,&rdquo; said he, in a lower tone: &ldquo;we
      will find a little retreat from which the invincible cannot possibly
      escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was well spoken, our ally!&rdquo; replied the duchesse. &ldquo;But it is getting
      late; had we not better return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more willingly, madame, from my having my preparations to make for
      setting out with the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Paris!&rdquo; cried the duchesse to the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine, after the
      conclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet,
      the last defender of Belle-Isle, the former friend of Marie Michon, the
      new foe of the old duchesse.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVII. The Two Lighters.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had set off; Fouquet likewise was gone, and with a rapidity
      which doubled the tender interest of his friends. The first moments of
      this journey, or better say, this flight, were troubled by a ceaseless
      dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive. It was
      not natural, in fact, if Louis XIV. was determined to seize this prey,
      that he should allow it to escape; the young lion was already accustomed
      to the chase, and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted.
      But insensibly all fears were dispersed; the surintendant, by hard
      traveling, placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors,
      that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him. As to
      his position, his friends had made it excellent for him. Was he not
      traveling to join the king at Nantes, and what did the rapidity prove but
      his zeal to obey? He arrived, fatigued, but reassured, at Orleans, where
      he found, thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him, a handsome
      lighter of eight oars. These lighters, in the shape of gondolas, somewhat
      wide and heavy, containing a small chamber, covered by the deck, and a
      chamber in the poop, formed by a tent, then acted as passage-boats from
      Orleans to Nantes, by the Loire, and this passage, a long one in our days,
      appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road, with its
      post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages. Fouquet went on board this lighter,
      which set out immediately. The rowers, knowing they had the honor of
      conveying the surintendant of the finances, pulled with all their
      strength, and that magic word, the <i>finances</i>, promised them a
      liberal gratification, of which they wished to prove themselves worthy.
      The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire. Magnificent
      weather, a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape, displayed the river
      in all its limpid serenity. The current and the rowers carried Fouquet
      along as wings carry a bird, and he arrived before Beaugency without the
      slightest accident having signalized the voyage. Fouquet hoped to be the
      first to arrive at Nantes; there he would see the notables and gain
      support among the principal members of the States; he would make himself a
      necessity, a thing very easy for a man of his merit, and would delay the
      catastrophe, if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo;
       said Gourville to him, &ldquo;at Nantes, you will make out, or we will make out,
      the intentions of your enemies; we will have horses always ready to convey
      you to Poitou, a bark in which to gain the sea, and when once upon the
      open sea, Belle-Isle is your inviolable port. You see, besides, that no
      one is watching you, no one is following.&rdquo; He had scarcely finished when
      they discovered at a distance, behind an elbow formed by the river, the
      masts of a huge lighter coming down. The rowers of Fouquet&rsquo;s boat uttered
      a cry of surprise on seeing this galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the patron of the bark, &ldquo;that it is
      a truly remarkable thing&mdash;that lighter comes along like a hurricane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gourville started, and mounted to the deck, in order to obtain a better
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet did not go up with him, but said to Gourville, with restrained
      mistrust: &ldquo;See what it is, dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lighter had just passed the elbow. It came on so fast, that behind it
      might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How they go,&rdquo; repeated the skipper, &ldquo;how they go! They must be well paid!
      I did not think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that oars of wood could behave better than
      ours, but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well they may,&rdquo; said one of the rowers, &ldquo;they are twelve, and we but
      eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve rowers!&rdquo; replied Gourville, &ldquo;twelve! impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded, even for
      the king. This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant, more for
      the sake of haste than of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; said Gourville, endeavoring to distinguish beneath
      the tent, which was already apparent, travelers which the most piercing
      eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be in a hurry, for it is not the king,&rdquo; said the patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what sign do you know that it is not the king?&rdquo; said Gourville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis,
      which the royal lighter always carries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;because it is impossible it should be the king,
      Gourville, as the king was still in Paris yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said: &ldquo;You were
      there yourself yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste?&rdquo; added he, for
      the sake of gaining time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this, monsieur,&rdquo; said the patron; &ldquo;these people must have set out a
      long while after us, and they have already nearly overtaken us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Gourville, &ldquo;who told you that they do not come from Beaugency
      or from Moit even?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have seen no lighter of that shape, except at Orleans. It comes from
      Orleans, monsieur, and makes great haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance. The captain remarked their
      uneasiness, and, to mislead him, Gourville immediately said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some friend, who has laid a wager he would catch us; let us win the
      wager, and not allow him to come up with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible, but
      Fouquet said with much <i>hauteur</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;If it is any one who wishes
      to overtake us, let him come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can try, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the man, timidly. &ldquo;Come, you fellows, put
      out your strength; row, row!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;on the contrary; stop short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur! what folly!&rdquo; interrupted Gourville, stooping towards his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull up!&rdquo; repeated Fouquet. The eight oars stopped, and resisting the
      water, created a retrograde motion. It stopped. The twelve rowers in the
      other did not, at first, perceive this maneuver, for they continued to
      urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within
      musket-shot. Fouquet was short-sighted, Gourville was annoyed by the sun,
      now full in his eyes; the skipper alone, with that habit and clearness
      which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements, perceived
      distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see them!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;there are two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see nothing,&rdquo; said Gourville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be long before you distinguish them; in twenty strokes of
      their oars they will be within ten paces of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But what the patron announced was not realized; the lighter imitated the
      movement commanded by Fouquet, and instead of coming to join its pretended
      friends, it stopped short in the middle of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot comprehend this,&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; cried Gourville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter,&rdquo; resumed Fouquet,
      &ldquo;try to describe them to us, before we are too far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I saw two,&rdquo; replied the boatman. &ldquo;I can only see one now, under
      the tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a dark man, broad-shouldered, bull-necked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little cloud at that moment passed across the azure, darkening the sun.
      Gourville, who was still looking, with one hand over his eyes, became able
      to see what he sought, and all at once, jumping from the deck into the
      chamber where Fouquet awaited him: &ldquo;Colbert!&rdquo; said he, in a voice broken
      by emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colbert!&rdquo; repeated Fouquet. &ldquo;Too strange! but no, it is impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I recognized him, and he, at the same time, so plainly
      recognized me, that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop. Perhaps
      the king has sent him on our track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case he would join us, instead of lying by. What is he doing
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is watching us, without a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like uncertainty,&rdquo; said Fouquet; &ldquo;let us go straight up to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monseigneur, do not do that, the lighter is full of armed men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wishes to arrest me, then, Gourville? Why does he not come on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even
      your ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing yet proves that they are watching you, monseigneur; be patient!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not stop; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king&rsquo;s
      order with zeal. Redouble the speed. He who lives will see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better. Come!&rdquo; cried Fouquet; &ldquo;since they remain stock-still
      yonder, let us go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain gave the signal, and Fouquet&rsquo;s rowers resumed their task with
      all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested. Scarcely
      had the lighter made a hundred fathoms, than the other, that with the
      twelve rowers, resumed its rapid course. This position lasted all day,
      without any increase or diminution of distance between the two vessels.
      Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor. He
      ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore, as if to effect a landing.
      Colbert&rsquo;s lighter imitated this maneuver, and steered towards the shore in
      a slanting direction. By the merest chance, at the spot where Fouquet
      pretended to wish to land, a stableman, from the chateau of Langeais, was
      following the flowery banks leading three horses in halters. Without doubt
      the people of the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing
      his course to these horses ready for flight, for four or five men, armed
      with muskets, jumped from the lighter on to the shore, and marched along
      the banks, as if to gain ground on the horseman. Fouquet, satisfied of
      having forced the enemy to a demonstration, considered his intention
      evident, and put his boat in motion again. Colbert&rsquo;s people returned
      likewise to theirs, and the course of the two vessels was resumed with
      fresh perseverance. Upon seeing this, Fouquet felt himself threatened
      closely, and in a prophetic voice&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Gourville,&rdquo; said he,
      whisperingly, &ldquo;what did I say at our last repast, at my house? Am I going,
      or not, to my ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two boats, which follow each other with so much emulation, as if we
      were disputing, M. Colbert and I, a prize for swiftness on the Loire, do
      they not aptly represent our fortunes; and do you not believe, Gourville,
      that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; objected Gourville, &ldquo;there is still uncertainty; you are about
      to appear at the States; you are about to show what sort of man you are;
      your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and sword that will
      serve to defend you, if not to conquer with. The Bretons do not know you;
      and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won! Oh! let M.
      Colbert look to it well, for his lighter is as much exposed as yours to
      being upset. Both go quickly, his faster than yours, it is true; we shall
      see which will be wrecked first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet, taking Gourville&rsquo;s hand&mdash;&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;everything
      considered, remember the proverb, &lsquo;First come, first served!&rsquo; Well! M.
      Colbert takes care not to pass me. He is a prudent man is M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was right; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes,
      watching each other. When the surintendant landed, Gourville hoped he
      should be able to seek refuge at once, and have the relays prepared. But,
      at the landing, the second lighter joined the first, and Colbert,
      approaching Fouquet, saluted him on the quay with marks of the profoundest
      respect&mdash;marks so significant, so public, that their result was the
      bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse. Fouquet was completely
      self-possessed; he felt that in his last moments of greatness he had
      obligations towards himself. He wished to fall from such a height that his
      fall should crush some of his enemies. Colbert was there&mdash;so much the
      worse for Colbert. The surintendant, therefore, coming up to him, replied,
      with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to him&mdash;&ldquo;What!
      is that you, M. Colbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To offer you my respects, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in that lighter?&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the one with twelve rowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of twelve rowers?&rdquo; said Fouquet; &ldquo;what luxury, M. Colbert. For a moment I
      thought it was the queen-mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo;&mdash;and Colbert blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it dear,
      Monsieur l&rsquo;Intendant!&rdquo; said Fouquet. &ldquo;But you have, happily, arrived!&mdash;You
      see, however,&rdquo; added he, a moment after, &ldquo;that I, who had but eight
      rowers, arrived before you.&rdquo; And he turned his back towards him, leaving
      him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter had escaped the
      notice of the first. At least he did not give him the satisfaction of
      showing that he had been frightened. Colbert, so annoyingly attacked, did
      not give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been quick, monseigneur,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;because I followed your
      example whenever you stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you do that, Monsieur Colbert?&rdquo; cried Fouquet, irritated by
      the base audacity; &ldquo;as you had a superior crew to mine, why did you not
      either join me or pass me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of respect,&rdquo; said the intendant, bowing to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him, we know not
      why or how, and he repaired to <i>la Maison de Nantes</i>, escorted by a
      vast crowd of people, who for several days had been agog with expectation
      of a convocation of the States. Scarcely was he installed when Gourville
      went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes, and a boat
      at Paimboef. He performed these various operations with so much mystery,
      activity, and generosity, that never was Fouquet, then laboring under an
      attack of fever, more nearly saved, except for the counteraction of that
      immense disturber of human projects,&mdash;chance. A report was spread
      during the night, that the king was coming in great haste on post horses,
      and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest. The people, while
      waiting for the king, were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers, newly
      arrived, with Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, their captain, and quartered in the
      castle, of which they occupied all the posts, in quality of guard of
      honor. M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, who was very polite, presented himself, about ten
      o&rsquo;clock, at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful
      compliments; and although the minister suffered from fever, although he
      was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat, he would receive M. d&rsquo;Artagnan,
      who was delighted with that honor, as will be seen by the conversation
      they had together.

      Chapter XXXVIII. Friendly Advice.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fouquet had gone to bed, like a man who clings to life, and wishes to
      economize, as much as possible, that slender tissue of existence, of which
      the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber, and was saluted by the
      superintendent with a very affable &ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bon jour!</i> monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the musketeer; &ldquo;how did you get

    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolerably well, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But poorly. I drink, as you perceive. I am scarcely arrived, and I have
      already levied a contribution of <i>tisane</i> upon Nantes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should sleep first, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! <i>corbleu!</i> my dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, I should be very glad to
      sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who hinders you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, <i>you</i> in the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you do. Is it at Nantes as at Paris? Do you not come in the
      king&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;leave the king
      alone! The day on which I shall come on the part of the king, for the
      purpose you mean, take my word for it, I will not leave you long in doubt.
      You will see me place my hand on my sword, according to the <i>ordonnance</i>,
      and you will hear my say at once, in ceremonial voice, &lsquo;Monseigneur, in
      the name of the king, I arrest you!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise me that frankness?&rdquo; said the superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor! But we have not come to that, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan? For my part, I think quite the
      contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard speak of nothing of the kind,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! eh!&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, no. You are an agreeable man, in spite of your fever. The king
      should not, cannot help loving you, at the bottom of his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet&rsquo;s expression implied doubt. &ldquo;But M. Colbert?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;does M.
      Colbert love me as much as you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not speaking of M. Colbert,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;He is an
      exceptional man. He does not love you; so much is very possible; but, <i>mordioux!</i>
      the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very little
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?&rdquo; replied
      Fouquet; &ldquo;and that, upon my life! I have never met with a man of your
      intelligence, and heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pleased to say so,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Why did you wait till
      to-day to pay me such a compliment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind that we are!&rdquo; murmured Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your voice is getting hoarse,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;drink, monseigneur,
      drink!&rdquo; And he offered him a cup of <i>tisane</i>, with the most friendly
      cordiality; Fouquet took it, and thanked him by a gentle smile. &ldquo;Such
      things only happen to me,&rdquo; said the musketeer. &ldquo;I have passed ten years
      under your very beard, while you were rolling about tons of gold. You were
      clearing an annual pension of four millions; you never observed me; and
      you find out there is such a person in the world, just at the moment you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just at the moment I am about to fall,&rdquo; interrupted Fouquet. &ldquo;That is
      true, my dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you thought so; and that is the same thing. Well! if I fall, take my
      word as truth, I shall not pass a single day without saying to myself, as
      I strike my brow, &lsquo;Fool! fool!&mdash;stupid mortal! You had a Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Artagnan under your eye and hand, and you did not employ him, you did
      not enrich him!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overwhelm me,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I esteem you greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There exists another man, then, who does not think as M. Colbert thinks,&rdquo;
       said the surintendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination! He is worse than
      fever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have good cause,&rdquo; said Fouquet. &ldquo;Judge for yourself.&rdquo; And he
      related the details of the course of the lighters, and the hypocritical
      persecution of Colbert. &ldquo;Is not this a clear sign of my ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan became very serious. &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes; it has an
      unsavory odor, as M. de Treville used to say.&rdquo; And he fixed on M. Fouquet
      his intelligent and significant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not clearly designated in that, captain? Is not the king bringing me
      to Nantes to get me away from Paris, where I have so many creatures, and
      to possess himself of Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where M. d&rsquo;Herblay is,&rdquo; added D&rsquo;Artagnan. Fouquet raised his head. &ldquo;As
      for me, monseigneur,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I can assure you the king has
      said nothing to me against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king commanded me to set out for Nantes, it is true; and to say
      nothing about it to M. de Gesvres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To M. de Gesvres, yes, monseigneur,&rdquo; continued the musketeer, whose eye s
      did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his lips.
      &ldquo;The king, moreover, commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers, which
      is apparently superfluous, as the country is quite quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brigade!&rdquo; said Fouquet, raising himself upon his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ninety-six horsemen, yes, monseigneur. The same number as were employed
      in arresting MM. de Chalais, de Cinq-Mars, and Montmorency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words, pronounced without apparent
      value. &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing but insignificant orders; such as guarding the castle,
      guarding every lodging, allowing none of M. de Gesvres&rsquo;s guards to occupy
      a single post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as to myself,&rdquo; cried Fouquet, &ldquo;what orders had you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to you, monseigneur?&mdash;not the smallest word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, my safety, my honor, perhaps my life are at stake.
      You would not deceive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;to what end? Are you threatened? Only there really is an order
      with respect to carriages and boats&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but it cannot concern you&mdash;a simple measure of police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, captain?&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes, without a pass, signed by
      the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God! but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan began to laugh. &ldquo;All that is not to be put into execution
      before the arrival of the king at Nantes. So that you see plainly,
      monseigneur, the order in nowise concerns you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet became thoughtful, and D&rsquo;Artagnan feigned not to observe his
      preoccupation. &ldquo;It is evident, by my thus confiding to you the orders
      which have been given to me, that I am friendly towards you, and that I am
      trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt!&mdash;without doubt!&rdquo; said Fouquet, still absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us recapitulate,&rdquo; said the captain, his glance beaming with
      earnestness. &ldquo;A special guard about the castle, in which your lodging is
      to be, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monseigneur, a regular prison! The absence of M. de Gesvres, who has
      the honor of being one of your friends. The closing of the gates of the
      city, and of the river without a pass; but, only when the king shall have
      arrived. Please to observe, Monsieur Fouquet, that if, instead of speaking
      to man like you, who are one of the first in the kingdom, I were speaking
      to a troubled, uneasy conscience&mdash;I should compromise myself forever.
      What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be free! No police, no
      guards, no orders; the water free, the roads free, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan
      obliged to lend his horses, if required. All this ought to reassure you,
      Monsieur Fouquet, for the king would not have left me thus independent, if
      he had any sinister designs. In truth, Monsieur Fouquet, ask me whatever
      you like, I am at your service; and, in return, if you will consent to do
      it, do me a service, that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos,
      in case you embark for Belle-Isle, as you have a right to do without
      changing your dress, immediately, in your <i>robe de chambre</i>&mdash;just
      as you are.&rdquo; Saying these words, and with a profound bow, the musketeer,
      whose looks had lost none of their intelligent kindness, left the
      apartment. He had not reached the steps of the vestibule, when Fouquet,
      quite beside himself, hung to the bell-rope, and shouted, &ldquo;My horses!&mdash;my
      lighter!&rdquo; But nobody answered. The surintendant dressed himself with
      everything that came to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gourville!&mdash;Gourville!&rdquo; cried he, while slipping his watch into his
      pocket. And the bell sounded again, whilst Fouquet repeated, &ldquo;Gourville!&mdash;Gourville!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gourville at length appeared, breathless and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be gone! Let us be gone!&rdquo; cried Fouquet, as soon as he saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late!&rdquo; said the surintendant&rsquo;s poor friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late!&mdash;why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of the
      castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean, Gourville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means the king is come, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king, who has ridden double stages, who has killed horses, and who is
      eight hours in advance of all our calculations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are lost!&rdquo; murmured Fouquet. &ldquo;Brave D&rsquo;Artagnan, all is over, thou has
      spoken to me too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, in fact, was entering the city, which soon resounded with the
      cannon from the ramparts, and from a vessel which replied from the lower
      parts of the river. Fouquet&rsquo;s brow darkened; he called his <i>valets de
      chambre</i> and dressed in ceremonial costume. From his window, behind the
      curtains, he could see the eagerness of the people, and the movement of a
      large troop, which had followed the prince. The king was conducted to the
      castle with great pomp, and Fouquet saw him dismount under the portcullis,
      and say something in the ear of D&rsquo;Artagnan, who held his stirrup.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, when the king had passed under the arch, directed his steps
      towards the house Fouquet was in; but so slowly, and stopping so
      frequently to speak to his musketeers, drawn up like a hedge, that it
      might be said he was counting the seconds, or the steps, before
      accomplishing his object. Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in the
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, on perceiving him, &ldquo;are you still there,
      monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that word <i>still</i> completed the proof to Fouquet of how much
      information and how many useful counsels were contained in the first visit
      the musketeer had paid him. The surintendant sighed deeply. &ldquo;Good heavens!
      yes, monsieur,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;The arrival of the king has interrupted me in
      the projects I had formed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you know that the king has arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, I have seen him; and this time you come from him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To inquire after you, monseigneur; and, if your health is not too bad, to
      beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, directly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>mordioux!</i>&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;now the king is come, there is
      no more walking for anybody&mdash;no more free will; the password governs
      all now, you as much as me, me as much as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet heaved a last sigh, climbed with difficulty into his carriage, so
      great was his weakness, and went to the castle, escorted by D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it had just before
      been consoling and cheerful.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIX. How the King, Louis XIV., Played His Little Part.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Fouquet was alighting from his carriage, to enter the castle of Nantes,
      a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest
      respect, and gave him a letter. D&rsquo;Artagnan endeavored to prevent this man
      from speaking to Fouquet, and pushed him away, but the message had been
      given to the surintendant. Fouquet opened the letter and read it, and
      instantly a vague terror, which D&rsquo;Artagnan did not fail to penetrate, was
      painted on the countenance of the first minister. Fouquet put the paper
      into the portfolio which he had under his arm, and passed on towards the
      king&rsquo;s apartments. D&rsquo;Artagnan, through the small windows made at every
      landing of the donjon stairs, saw, as he went up behind Fouquet, the man
      who had delivered the note, looking round him on the place and making
      signs to several persons, who disappeared in the adjacent streets, after
      having themselves repeated the signals. Fouquet was made to wait for a
      moment on the terrace of which we have spoken,&mdash;a terrace which
      abutted on the little corridor, at the end of which the cabinet of the
      king was located. Here D&rsquo;Artagnan passed on before the surintendant, whom,
      till that time, he had respectfully accompanied, and entered the royal
      cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Louis XIV., who, on perceiving him, threw on to the table
      covered with papers a large green cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The order is executed, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le surintendant follows me,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ten minutes let him be introduced,&rdquo; said the king, dismissing
      D&rsquo;Artagnan again with a gesture. The latter retired; but had scarcely
      reached the corridor at the extremity of which Fouquet was waiting for
      him, when he was recalled by the king&rsquo;s bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he not appear astonished?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fouquet</i>,&rdquo; replied the king, without saying monsieur, a peculiarity
      which confirmed the captain of the musketeers in his suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire,&rdquo; replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; And a second time Louis dismissed D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide.
      He reperused his note, conceived thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is being contrived against you. Perhaps they will not dare to
      carry it out at the castle; it will be on your return home. The house is
      already surrounded by musketeers. Do not enter. A white horse is in
      waiting for you behind the esplanade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville. Not being willing
      that, if any evil happened to himself, this paper should compromise a
      faithful friend, the surintendant was busy tearing it into a thousand
      morsels, spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the terrace.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan found him watching the snowflake fluttering of the last scraps
      in space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the king awaits you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor, where MM.
      de Brienne and Rose were at work, whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan, seated
      on a chair, likewise in the corridor, appeared to be waiting for orders,
      with feverish impatience, his sword between his legs. It appeared strange
      to Fouquet that MM. Brienne, Rose, and de Saint-Aignan, in general so
      attentive and obsequious, should scarcely take the least notice, as he,
      the surintendant, passed. But how could he expect to find it otherwise
      among courtiers, he whom the king no longer called anything but <i>Fouquet?</i>
      He raised his head, determined to look every one and everything bravely in
      the face, and entered the king&rsquo;s apartment, where a little bell, which we
      already know, had already announced him to his majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, without rising, nodded to him, and with interest: &ldquo;Well! how are
      you, Monsieur Fouquet?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in a high fever,&rdquo; replied the surintendant; &ldquo;but I am at the king&rsquo;s
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well; the States assemble to-morrow; have you a speech ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet looked at the king with astonishment. &ldquo;I have not, sire,&rdquo; replied
      he; &ldquo;but I will improvise one. I am too well acquainted with affairs to
      feel any embarrassment. I have only one question to ask; will your majesty
      permit me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him
      notice of this in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were ill; I was not willing to fatigue you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never did a labor&mdash;never did an explanation fatigue me, sire; and
      since the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Monsieur Fouquet! an explanation? An explanation, pray, of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your majesty&rsquo;s intentions with respect to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king blushed. &ldquo;I have been calumniated,&rdquo; continued Fouquet, warmly,
      &ldquo;and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make
      inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say all this to me very uselessly, Monsieur Fouquet; I know what I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you; and I,
      on my part, have said nothing to you, whilst others have spoken many, many
      times&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish to say?&rdquo; said the king, impatient to put an end to this
      embarrassing conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go straight to the facts, sire; and I accuse a certain man of
      having injured me in your majesty&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has injured you, Monsieur Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reply proves to me, sire, that I am right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Fouquet, I do not like people to be accused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when one is accused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have already spoken too much about this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat that I do not accuse you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet, with a half-bow, made a step backward. &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; thought
      he, &ldquo;that he has made up his mind. He alone who cannot go back can show
      such obstinacy. Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed; not
      to shun it would be stupid.&rdquo; He resumed aloud, &ldquo;Did your majesty send for
      me on business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur Fouquet, but for some advice I wish to give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I respectfully await it, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest yourself, Monsieur Fouquet, do not throw away your strength; the
      session of the States will be short, and when my secretaries shall have
      closed it, I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a
      fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of the
      States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to me, the surintendant of the finances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest yourself, I beg you; that is all I have to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet bit his lips and hung his head. He was evidently busy with some
      uneasy thought. This uneasiness struck the king. &ldquo;Are you angry at having
      to rest yourself, M. Fouquet?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, I am not accustomed to take rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are ill; you must take care of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His majesty made no reply; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him. Fouquet
      felt the weight of this hesitation. He thought he could read danger in the
      eyes of the young prince, which fear would but precipitate. &ldquo;If I appear
      frightened, I am lost,&rdquo; thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, on his part, was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet. &ldquo;Has he a
      suspicion of anything?&rdquo; murmured he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his first word is severe,&rdquo; again thought Fouquet; &ldquo;if he becomes
      angry, or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext, how shall I
      extricate myself? Let us smooth the declivity a little. Gourville was
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said he, suddenly, &ldquo;since the goodness of the king watches over my
      health to the point of dispensing with my labor, may I not be allowed to
      be absent from the council of to-morrow? I could pass the day in bed, and
      will entreat the king to grant me his physician, that we may endeavor to
      find a remedy against this fearful fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, Monsieur Fouquet, it shall be as you desire; you shall have a
      holiday to-morrow, you shall have the physician, and shall be restored to
      health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said Fouquet, bowing. Then, opening his game: &ldquo;Shall I not have
      the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he looked Louis full in the face, to judge of the effect of such a
      proposal. The king blushed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; replied he, endeavoring to smile, &ldquo;that you have just said,
      &lsquo;My residence of Belle-Isle&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! do you not remember,&rdquo; continued the king in the same cheerful tone,
      &ldquo;that you gave me Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true again, sire. Only, as you have not taken it, you will
      doubtless come with me and take possession of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was, besides, your majesty&rsquo;s intention as well as mine; and I cannot
      express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see all the
      king&rsquo;s regiments from Paris to help take possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am convinced of that,&rdquo; said Fouquet, warmly; &ldquo;your majesty knows
      very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in
      your hand, to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Peste!</i>&rdquo; cried the king; &ldquo;I do not wish those fine fortifications,
      which cost so much to build, to fall at all. No, let them stand against
      the Dutch and English. You would not guess what I want to see at
      Belle-Isle, Monsieur Fouquet; it is the pretty peasants and women of the
      lands on the sea-shore, who dance so well, and are so seducing with their
      scarlet petticoats! I have heard great boast of your pretty tenants,
      monsieur le surintendant; well, let me have a sight of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever your majesty pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any means of transport? It shall be to-morrow, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surintendant felt this stroke, which was not adroit, and replied, &ldquo;No,
      sire; I was ignorant of your majesty&rsquo;s wish; above all, I was ignorant of
      your haste to see Belle-Isle, and I am prepared with nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a boat of your own, nevertheless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have five; but they are all in port, or at Paimboeuf; and to join them,
      or bring them hither, would require at least twenty-four hours. Have I any
      occasion to send a courier? Must I do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little, put an end to the fever,&mdash;wait till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred
      other ideas?&rdquo; replied Fouquet, now perfectly convinced and very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king started, and stretched his hand out towards his little bell, but
      Fouquet prevented his ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have an ague&mdash;I am trembling with cold. If I
      remain a moment longer, I shall most likely faint. I request your
      majesty&rsquo;s permission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you are in a shiver; it is painful to behold! Come, Monsieur
      Fouquet, begone! I will send to inquire after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness. In an hour I shall be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call some one to reconduct you,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, sire; I would gladly take the arm of any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; cried the king, ringing his little bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire,&rdquo; interrupted Fouquet, laughing in such a manner as made the
      prince feel cold, &ldquo;would you give me the captain of your musketeers to
      take me to my lodgings? An equivocal honor that, sire! A simple footman, I
      beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, M. Fouquet? M. d&rsquo;Artagnan conducts me often, and extremely
      well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but when he conducts you, sire, it is to obey you; whilst me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the musketeers,
      it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrested!&rdquo; replied the king, who became paler than Fouquet himself,&mdash;&ldquo;arrested!
      oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should they not say so?&rdquo; continued Fouquet, still laughing; &ldquo;and
      I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to laugh at
      it.&rdquo; This sally disconcerted the monarch. Fouquet was skillful enough, or
      fortunate enough, to make Louis XIV. recoil before the appearance of the
      deed he meditated. M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, when he appeared, received an order to
      desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite unnecessary,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;sword for sword; I prefer
      Gourville, who is waiting for me below. But that will not prevent me
      enjoying the society of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan. I am glad he will see Belle-Isle,
      he is so good a judge of fortifications.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan bowed, without at all comprehending what was going on. Fouquet
      bowed again and left the apartment, affecting all the slowness of a man
      who walks with difficulty. When once out of the castle, &ldquo;I am saved!&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Oh! yes, disloyal king, you shall see Belle-Isle, but it shall be
      when I am no longer there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared, leaving D&rsquo;Artagnan with the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of a
      hundred paces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to his lodgings again. You will go with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will arrest him in my name, and will shut him up in a carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a carriage. Well, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a fashion that he may not, on the road, either converse with any
      one or throw notes to people he may meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be rather difficult, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sire, I cannot stifle M. Fouquet, and if he asks for liberty
      to breathe, I cannot prevent him by closing both the windows and the
      blinds. He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case is provided for, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan; a carriage with a trellis
      will obviate both the difficulties you point out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A carriage with an iron trellis!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;but a carriage with
      an iron trellis is not made in half an hour, and your majesty commands me
      to go immediately to M. Fouquet&rsquo;s lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage in question is already made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is quite a different thing,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;if the carriage
      is ready made, very well, then, we have only to set it in motion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ready&mdash;and the horses harnessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the coachman, with the outriders, is waiting in the lower court of
      the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan bowed. &ldquo;There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither I
      shall conduct M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the castle of Angers, at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards we will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, one last word: you have remarked that, for making
      this capture of M. Fouquet, I have not employed my guards, on which
      account M. de Gesvres will be furious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty does not employ your guards,&rdquo; said the captain, a little
      humiliated, &ldquo;because you mistrust M. de Gesvres, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, monsieur, that I have more confidence in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that very well, sire! and it is of no use to make so much of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only for the sake of arriving at this, monsieur, that if, from this
      moment, it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet should
      escape&mdash;such chances have been, monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very often, sire; but for others, not for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I, sire, have, for an instant, wished to save M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king started. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;I had then a right to
      do so, having guessed your majesty&rsquo;s plan, without you having spoken to me
      of it, and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet. Now, was I not at
      liberty to show my interest in this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, monsieur, you do not reassure me with regard to your services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had saved him then, I should have been perfectly innocent; I will
      say more, I should have done well, for M. Fouquet is not a bad man. But he
      was not willing; his destiny prevailed; he let the hour of liberty slip
      by. So much the worse! Now I have orders, I will obey those orders, and M.
      Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested. He is at the castle of Angers,
      this very M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you have not got him yet, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That concerns me; every one to his trade, sire; only, once more, reflect!
      Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a thousand times, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In writing, sire, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan read it, bowed to the king, and left the room. From the height
      of the terrace he perceived Gourville, who went by with a joyous air
      towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet.

    <h2>
      Chapter XL: The White Horse and the Black.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather surprising,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;Gourville running about the
      streets so gayly, when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in danger;
      when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who warned M.
      Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand pieces upon
      the terrace, and given to the winds by monsieur le surintendant. Gourville
      is rubbing his hands; that is because he has done something clever. Whence
      comes M. Gourville? Gourville is coming from the Rue aux Herbes. Whither
      does the Rue aux Herbes lead?&rdquo; And D&rsquo;Artagnan followed, along the tops of
      the houses of Nantes, dominated by the castle, the line traced by the
      streets, as he would have done upon a topographical plan; only, instead of
      the dead, flat paper, the living chart rose in relief with the cries, the
      movements, and the shadows of men and things. Beyond the inclosure of the
      city, the great verdant plains stretched out, bordering the Loire, and
      appeared to run towards the pink horizon, which was cut by the azure of
      the waters and the dark green of the marshes. Immediately outside the
      gates of Nantes two white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers
      of a gigantic hand. D&rsquo;Artagnan, who had taken in all the panorama at a
      glance by crossing the terrace, was led by the line of the Rue aux Herbes
      to the mouth of one of those roads which took its rise under the gates of
      Nantes. One step more, and he was about to descend the stairs, take his
      trellised carriage, and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet. But chance
      decreed, at the moment of plunging into the staircase, that he was
      attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said the musketeer to himself; &ldquo;a horse galloping,&mdash;a
      runaway horse, no doubt. What a rate he is going at!&rdquo; The moving point
      became detached from the road, and entered into the fields. &ldquo;A white
      horse,&rdquo; continued the captain, who had just observed the color thrown
      luminously against the dark ground, &ldquo;and he is mounted; it must be some
      boy whose horse is thirsty and has run away with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These reflections, rapid as lightning, simultaneous with visual
      perception, D&rsquo;Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the first
      steps of the staircase. Some morsels of paper were spread over the stairs,
      and shone out white against the dirty stones. &ldquo;Eh! eh!&rdquo; said the captain
      to himself, &ldquo;here are some of the fragments of the note torn by M.
      Fouquet. Poor man! he has given his secret to the wind; the wind will have
      no more to do with it, and brings it back to the king. Decidedly, Fouquet,
      you play with misfortune! the game is not a fair one,&mdash;fortune is
      against you. The star of Louis XIV. obscures yours; the adder is stronger
      and more cunning than the squirrel.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan picked up one of these
      morsels of paper as he descended. &ldquo;Gourville&rsquo;s pretty little hand!&rdquo; cried
      he, whilst examining one of the fragments of the note; &ldquo;I was not
      mistaken.&rdquo; And he read the word &ldquo;horse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said he; and he examined
      another, upon which there was not a letter traced. Upon a third he read
      the word &ldquo;white;&rdquo; &ldquo;white horse,&rdquo; repeated he, like a child that is
      spelling. &ldquo;Ah, <i>mordioux!</i>&rdquo; cried the suspicious spirit, &ldquo;a white
      horse!&rdquo; And, like that grain of powder which, burning, dilates into ten
      thousand times its volume, D&rsquo;Artagnan, enlightened by ideas and
      suspicions, rapidly reascended the stairs towards the terrace. The white
      horse was still galloping in the direction of the Loire, at the extremity
      of which, melting into the vapors of the water, a little sail appeared,
      wave-balanced like a water-butterfly. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the musketeer, &ldquo;only a
      man who wants to fly would go at that pace across plowed lands; there is
      but one Fouquet, a financier, to ride thus in open day upon a white horse;
      there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle who would make his escape
      towards the sea, while there are such thick forests on land, and there is
      but one D&rsquo;Artagnan in the world to catch M. Fouquet, who has half an
      hour&rsquo;s start, and who will have gained his boat within an hour.&rdquo; This
      being said, the musketeer gave orders that the carriage with the iron
      trellis should be taken immediately to a thicket situated just outside the
      city. He selected his best horse, jumped upon his back, galloped along the
      Rue aux Herbes, taking, not the road Fouquet had taken, but the bank
      itself of the Loire, certain that he should gain ten minutes upon the
      total distance, and, at the intersection of the two lines, come up with
      the fugitive, who could have no suspicion of being pursued in that
      direction. In the rapidity of the pursuit, and with the impatience of the
      avenger, animating himself as in war, D&rsquo;Artagnan, so mild, so kind towards
      Fouquet, was surprised to find himself become ferocious&mdash;almost
      sanguinary. For a long time he galloped without catching sight of the
      white horse. His rage assumed fury, he doubted himself,&mdash;he suspected
      that Fouquet had buried himself in some subterranean road, or that he had
      changed the white horse for one of those famous black ones, as swift as
      the wind, which D&rsquo;Artagnan, at Saint-Mande, had so frequently admired and
      envied for their vigor and their fleetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such moments, when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears spring
      from them, when the saddle had become burning hot, when the galled and
      spurred horse reared with pain, and threw behind him a shower of dust and
      stones, D&rsquo;Artagnan, raising himself in his stirrups, and seeing nothing on
      the waters, nothing beneath the trees, looked up into the air like a
      madman. He was losing his senses. In the paroxysms of eagerness he dreamt
      of aerial ways,&mdash;the discovery of following century; he called to his
      mind Daedalus and the vast wings that had saved him from the prisons of
      Crete. A hoarse sigh broke from his lips, as he repeated, devoured by the
      fear of ridicule, &ldquo;I! I! duped by a Gourville! I! They will say that I am
      growing old,&mdash;they will say I have received a million to allow
      Fouquet to escape!&rdquo; And he again dug his spurs into the sides of his
      horse: he had ridden astonishingly fast. Suddenly, at the extremity of
      some open pasture-ground, behind the hedges, he saw a white form which
      showed itself, disappeared, and at last remained distinctly visible
      against the rising ground. D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s heart leaped with joy. He wiped
      the streaming sweat from his brow, relaxed the tension of his knees,&mdash;by
      which the horse breathed more freely,&mdash;and, gathering up his reins,
      moderated the speed of the vigorous animal, his active accomplice on this
      man-hunt. He had then time to study the direction of the road, and his
      position with regard to Fouquet. The superintendent had completely winded
      his horse by crossing the soft ground. He felt the necessity of gaining a
      firmer footing, and turned towards the road by the shortest secant line.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, on his part, had nothing to do but to ride straight on,
      concealed by the sloping shore; so that he would cut his quarry off the
      road when he came up with him. Then the real race would begin,&mdash;then
      the struggle would be in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan gave his horse good breathing-time. He observed that the
      superintendent had relaxed into a trot, which was to say, he, too, was
      favoring his horse. But both of them were too much pressed for time to
      allow them to continue long at that pace. The white horse sprang off like
      an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground. D&rsquo;Artagnan dropped his
      head, and his black horse broke into a gallop. Both followed the same
      route; the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were confounded.
      Fouquet had not yet perceived D&rsquo;Artagnan. But on issuing from the slope, a
      single echo struck the air; it was that of the steps of D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s
      horse, which rolled along like thunder. Fouquet turned round, and saw
      behind him, within a hundred paces, his enemy bent over the neck of his
      horse. There could be no doubt&mdash;the shining baldrick, the red cassock&mdash;it
      was a musketeer. Fouquet slackened his hand likewise, and the white horse
      placed twenty feet more between his adversary and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan, becoming very anxious, &ldquo;that is not a
      common horse M. Fouquet is upon&mdash;let us see!&rdquo; And he attentively
      examined with his infallible eye the shape and capabilities of the
      courser. Round full quarters&mdash;a thin long tail&mdash;large hocks&mdash;thin
      legs, as dry as bars of steel&mdash;hoofs hard as marble. He spurred his
      own, but the distance between the two remained the same. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      listened attentively; not a breath of the horse reached him, and yet he
      seemed to cut the air. The black horse, on the contrary, began to puff
      like any blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must overtake him, if I kill my horse,&rdquo; thought the musketeer; and he
      began to saw the mouth of the poor animal, whilst he buried the rowels of
      his merciless spurs into his sides. The maddened horse gained twenty
      toises, and came up within pistol-shot of Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; said the musketeer to himself, &ldquo;courage! the white horse will
      perhaps grow weaker, and if the horse does not fall, the master must pull
      up at last.&rdquo; But horse and rider remained upright together, gaining ground
      by difficult degrees. D&rsquo;Artagnan uttered a wild cry, which made Fouquet
      turn round, and added speed to the white horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A famous horse! a mad rider!&rdquo; growled the captain. &ldquo;Hola! <i>mordioux!</i>
      Monsieur Fouquet! stop! in the king&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; Fouquet made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo; shouted D&rsquo;Artagnan, whose horse had just stumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo; replied Fouquet, laconically; and rode on faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was nearly mad; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and his
      eyes. &ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; cried he again, &ldquo;stop, or I will bring you
      down with a pistol-shot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do!&rdquo; replied Fouquet, without relaxing his speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan seized a pistol and cocked it, hoping that the double click of
      the spring would stop his enemy. &ldquo;You have pistols likewise,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;turn and defend yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet did turn round at the noise, and looking D&rsquo;Artagnan full in the
      face, opened, with his right hand, the part of his dress which concealed
      his body, but he did not even touch his holsters. There were not more than
      twenty paces between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordioux!</i>&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I will not assassinate you; if you
      will not fire upon me, surrender! what is a prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather die!&rdquo; replied Fouquet; &ldquo;I shall suffer less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, drunk with despair, hurled his pistol to the ground. &ldquo;I will
      take you alive!&rdquo; said he; and by a prodigy of skill which this
      incomparable horseman alone was capable, he threw his horse forward to
      within ten paces of the white horse; already his hand was stretched out to
      seize his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill me! kill me!&rdquo; cried Fouquet, &ldquo;&lsquo;twould be more humane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! alive&mdash;alive!&rdquo; murmured the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment his horse made a false step for the second time, and
      Fouquet&rsquo;s again took the lead. It was an unheard-of spectacle, this race
      between two horses which now only kept alive by the will of their riders.
      It might be said that D&rsquo;Artagnan rode, carrying his horse along between
      his knees. To the furious gallop had succeeded the fast trot, and that had
      sunk to what might be scarcely called a trot at all. But the chase
      appeared equally warm in the two fatigued <i>athletoe</i>. D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      quite in despair, seized his second pistol, and cocked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your horse! not at you!&rdquo; cried he to Fouquet. And he fired. The animal
      was hit in the quarters&mdash;he made a furious bound, and plunged
      forward. At that moment D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s horse fell dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dishonored!&rdquo; thought the musketeer; &ldquo;I am a miserable wretch! for
      pity&rsquo;s sake, M. Fouquet, throw me one of your pistols, that I may blow out
      my brains!&rdquo; But Fouquet rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake! for mercy&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;that which you
      will not do at this moment, I myself will do within an hour, but here,
      upon this road, I should die bravely; I should die esteemed; do me that
      service, M. Fouquet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Fouquet made no reply, but continued to trot on. D&rsquo;Artagnan began to
      run after his enemy. Successively he threw away his hat, his coat, which
      embarrassed him, and then the sheath of his sword, which got between his
      legs as he was running. The sword in his hand itself became too heavy, and
      he threw it after the sheath. The white horse began to rattle in its
      throat; D&rsquo;Artagnan gained upon him. From a trot the exhausted animal sunk
      to a staggering walk&mdash;the foam from his mouth was mixed with blood.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made a desperate effort, sprang towards Fouquet, and seized him
      by the leg, saying in a broken, breathless voice, &ldquo;I arrest you in the
      king&rsquo;s name! blow my brains out, if you like; we have both done our duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet hurled far from him, into the river, the two pistols D&rsquo;Artagnan
      might have seized, and dismounting from his horse&mdash;&ldquo;I am your
      prisoner, monsieur,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;will you take my arm, for I see you are
      ready to faint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan, who, in fact, felt the earth sliding from
      under his feet, and the light of day turning to blackness around him; then
      he rolled upon the sand, without breath or strength. Fouquet hastened to
      the brink of the river, dipped some water in his hat, with which he bathed
      the temples of the musketeer, and introduced a few drop between his lips.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan raised himself with difficulty, and looked about him with a
      wandering eye. He beheld Fouquet on his knees, with his wet hat in his
      hand, smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness. &ldquo;You are not off, then?&rdquo;
       cried he. &ldquo;Oh, monsieur! the true king of royalty, in heart, in soul, is
      not Louis of the Louvre, or Philippe of Sainte-Marguerite; it is you,
      proscribed, condemned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, who this day am ruined by a single error, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in the name of Heaven, is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have had you for a friend! But how shall we return to Nantes? We
      are a great way from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white horse will recover, perhaps; he is a good horse! Mount,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan; I will walk till you have rested a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor beast! and wounded, too?&rdquo; said the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will go, I tell you; I know him; but we can do better still, let us
      both get up, and ride slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; said the captain. But they had scarcely charged the animal
      with this double load, when he began to stagger, and then with a great
      effort walked a few minutes, then staggered again, and sank down dead by
      the side of the black horse, which he had just managed to come up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go on foot&mdash;destiny wills it so&mdash;the walk will be
      pleasant,&rdquo; said Fouquet, passing his arm through that of D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordioux!</i>&rdquo; cried the latter, with a fixed eye, a contracted brow,
      and a swelling heart&mdash;&ldquo;What a disgraceful day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little
      wood behind which the carriage and escort were in waiting. When Fouquet
      perceived that sinister machine, he said to D&rsquo;Artagnan, who cast down his
      eyes, ashamed of Louis XIV., &ldquo;There is an idea that did not emanate from a
      brave man, Captain d&rsquo;Artagnan; it is not yours. What are these gratings
      for?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prevent your throwing letters out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ingenious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can speak, if you cannot write,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly, if you wish to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet reflected for a moment, then looking the captain full in the face,
      &ldquo;One single word,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;will you remember it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you speak it to whom I wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Mande,&rdquo; articulated Fouquet, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! and for whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Madame de Belliere or Pelisson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage rolled through Nantes, and took the route to Angers.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLI. In Which the Squirrel Falls,&mdash;the Adder Flies.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. The king, full of impatience, went to
      his cabinet on the terrace, and kept opening the door of the corridor, to
      see what his secretaries were doing. M. Colbert, seated in the same place
      M. de Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning, was chatting in a
      low voice with M. de Brienne. The king opened the door suddenly, and
      addressed them. &ldquo;What is it you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of the first sitting of the States,&rdquo; said M. de Brienne,
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the king, and returned to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after, the summons of the bell recalled Rose, whose hour it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished your copies?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if M. d&rsquo;Artagnan has returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; murmured the king. &ldquo;Call M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert entered; he had been expecting this all the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Colbert,&rdquo; said the king, very sharply; &ldquo;you must ascertain what
      has become of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert in his calm voice replied, &ldquo;Where does your majesty desire him to
      be sought for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! monsieur! do you not know on what I have sent him?&rdquo; replied Louis,
      acrimoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty did not inform me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, there are things that must be guessed; and you, above all, are
      apt to guess them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have been able to imagine, sire; but I do not presume to be
      positive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of the
      king interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the
      monarch and his clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; cried the king, with evident joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, pale and in evidently bad humor, cried to the king, as he
      entered, &ldquo;Sire, is it your majesty who has given orders to my musketeers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What orders?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About M. Fouquet&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None!&rdquo; replied Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, biting his mustache; &ldquo;I was not mistaken, then; it
      was monsieur here;&rdquo; and he pointed to Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What orders? Let me know,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders to turn the house topsy-turvy, to beat M. Fouquet&rsquo;s servants, to
      force the drawers, to give over a peaceful house to pillage! <i>Mordioux!</i>
      these are savage orders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; said Colbert, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;the king alone, understand,&mdash;the
      king alone has a right to command my musketeers; but, as to you, I forbid
      you to do it, and I tell you so before his majesty; gentlemen who carry
      swords do not sling pens behind their ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan! D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; murmured the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is humiliating,&rdquo; continued the musketeer; &ldquo;my soldiers are disgraced.
      I do not command <i>reitres</i>, thank you, nor clerks of the intendant,
      <i>mordioux!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! but what is all this about?&rdquo; said the king with authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this, sire; monsieur&mdash;monsieur, who could not guess your
      majesty&rsquo;s orders, and consequently could not know I was gone to arrest M.
      Fouquet; monsieur, who has caused the iron cage to be constructed for his
      patron of yesterday&mdash;has sent M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings of
      M. Fouquet, and, under the pretense of securing the surintendant&rsquo;s papers,
      they have taken away the furniture. My musketeers have been posted round
      the house all the morning; such were my orders. Why did any one presume to
      order them to enter? Why, by forcing them to assist in this pillage, have
      they been made accomplices in it? <i>Mordioux!</i> we serve the king, we
      do; but we do not serve M. Colbert!&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-5"
       name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the king, sternly, &ldquo;take care; it is not in my
      presence that such explanations, and made in such a tone, should take
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have acted for the good of the king,&rdquo; said Colbert, in a faltering
      voice. &ldquo;It is hard to be so treated by one of your majesty&rsquo;s officers, and
      that without redress, on account of the respect I owe the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The respect you owe the king,&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, his eyes flashing fire,
      &ldquo;consists, in the first place, in making his authority respected, and his
      person beloved. Every agent of a power without control represents that
      power, and when people curse the hand which strikes them, it is the royal
      hand that God reproaches, do you hear? Must a soldier, hardened by forty
      years of wounds and blood, give you this lesson, monsieur? Must mercy be
      on my side, and ferocity on yours? You have caused the innocent to be
      arrested, bound, and imprisoned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accomplices, perhaps, of M. Fouquet,&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you M. Fouquet had accomplices, or even that he was guilty? The
      king alone knows that; his justice is not blind! When he says, &lsquo;Arrest and
      imprison&rsquo; such and such a man, he is obeyed. Do not talk to me, then, any
      more of the respect you owe the king, and be careful of your words, that
      they may not chance to convey the slightest menace; for the king will not
      allow those to be threatened who do him service by others who do him
      disservice; and if in case I should have, which God forbid! a master so
      ungrateful, I would make myself respected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, D&rsquo;Artagnan took his station haughtily in the king&rsquo;s cabinet,
      his eyes flashing, his hand on his sword, his lips trembling, affecting
      much more anger than he really felt. Colbert, humiliated and devoured with
      rage, bowed to the king as if to ask his permission to leave the room. The
      king, thwarted alike in pride and in curiosity, knew not which part to
      take. D&rsquo;Artagnan saw him hesitate. To remain longer would have been a
      mistake: it was necessary to score a triumph over Colbert, and the only
      method was to touch the king so near the quick, that his majesty would
      have no other means of extrication but choosing between the two
      antagonists. D&rsquo;Artagnan bowed as Colbert had done; but the king, who, in
      preference to everything else, was anxious to have all the exact details
      of the arrest of the surintendant of the finances from him who had made
      him tremble for a moment,&mdash;the king, perceiving that the ill-humor of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan would put off for half an hour at least the details he was
      burning to be acquainted with,&mdash;Louis, we say, forgot Colbert, who
      had nothing new to tell him, and recalled his captain of the musketeers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let me see the result of your commission,
      monsieur; you may rest yourself hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, who was just passing through the doorway, stopped at the voice
      of the king, retraced his steps, and Colbert was forced to leave the
      closet. His countenance assumed almost a purple hue, his black and
      threatening eyes shone with a dark fire beneath their thick brows; he
      stepped out, bowed before the king, half drew himself up in passing
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, and went away with death in his heart. D&rsquo;Artagnan, on being
      left alone with the king, softened immediately, and composing his
      countenance: &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are a young king. It is by the dawn
      that people judge whether the day will be fine or dull. How, sire, will
      the people, whom the hand of God has placed under your law, argue of your
      reign, if between them and you, you allow angry and violent ministers to
      interpose their mischief? But let us speak of myself, sire, let us leave a
      discussion that may appear idle, and perhaps inconvenient to you. Let us
      speak of myself. I have arrested M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took plenty of time about it,&rdquo; said the king, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan looked at the king. &ldquo;I perceive that I have expressed myself
      badly. I announced to your majesty that I had arrested Monsieur Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did; and what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I ought to have told your majesty that M. Fouquet had arrested me;
      that would have been more just. I re-establish the truth, then; I have
      been arrested by M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now the turn of Louis XIV. to be surprised. His majesty was
      astonished in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, with his quick glance, appreciated what was passing in the
      heart of his master. He did not allow him time to put any questions. He
      related, with that poetry, that picturesqueness, which perhaps he alone
      possessed at that period, the escape of Fouquet, the pursuit, the furious
      race, and, lastly, the inimitable generosity of the surintendant, who
      might have fled ten times over, who might have killed the adversary in the
      pursuit, but who had preferred imprisonment, perhaps worse, to the
      humiliation of one who wished to rob him of his liberty. In proportion as
      the tale advanced, the king became agitated, devouring the narrator&rsquo;s
      words, and drumming with his finger-nails upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It results from all this, sire, in my eyes, at least, that the man who
      conducts himself thus is a gallant man, and cannot be an enemy to the
      king. That is my opinion, and I repeat it to your majesty. I know what the
      king will say to me, and I bow to it,&mdash;reasons of state. So be it! To
      my ears that sounds highly respectable. But I am a soldier, and I have
      received my orders, my orders are executed&mdash;very unwillingly on my
      part, it is true, but they are executed. I say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is M. Fouquet at this moment?&rdquo; asked Louis, after a short silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet, sire,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;is in the iron cage that M.
      Colbert had prepared for him, and is galloping as fast as four strong
      horses can drag him, towards Angers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave him on the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers. The proof, the best
      proof of what I advance, is that the king desired me to be sought for but
      this minute. And then I had another reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst I was with him, poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried the king, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty ought to understand, and does understand, certainly, that my
      warmest wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty. I have given him
      one of my brigadiers, the most stupid I could find among my musketeers, in
      order that the prisoner might have a chance of escaping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo; cried the king, crossing his arms on
      his breast. &ldquo;Do people utter such enormities, even when they have the
      misfortune to think them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sire, you cannot expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet,
      after what he has just done for you and me. No, no; if you desire that he
      should remain under your lock and bolt, never give him in charge to me;
      however closely wired might be the cage, the bird would, in the end, take
      wing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised,&rdquo; said the king, in his sternest tone, &ldquo;you did not follow
      the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my throne. You had
      in him all you want&mdash;affection, gratitude. In my service, monsieur,
      you will only find a master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile, sire,&rdquo; replied
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a deeply impressive manner, &ldquo;one single man would have
      gone there, and I should have been that man&mdash;you know that right
      well, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was brought to a pause. Before that speech of his captain of the
      musketeers, so frankly spoken and so true, the king had nothing to offer.
      On hearing D&rsquo;Artagnan, Louis remembered the D&rsquo;Artagnan of former times;
      him who, at the Palais Royal, held himself concealed behind the curtains
      of his bed, when the people of Paris, led by Cardinal de Retz, came to
      assure themselves of the presence of the king; the D&rsquo;Artagnan whom he
      saluted with his hand at the door of his carriage, when repairing to Notre
      Dame on his return to Paris; the soldier who had quitted his service at
      Blois; the lieutenant he had recalled to be beside his person when the
      death of Mazarin restored his power; the man he had always found loyal,
      courageous, devoted. Louis advanced towards the door and called Colbert.
      Colbert had not left the corridor where the secretaries were at work. He
      reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colbert, did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has it produced?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Roncherolles, who was sent with your majesty&rsquo;s musketeers, has
      remitted me some papers,&rdquo; replied Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will look at them. Give me your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hand, sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I may place it in that of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan. In fact, M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; added he, with a smile, turning towards the soldier, who, at
      sight of the clerk, had resumed his haughty attitude, &ldquo;you do not know
      this man; make his acquaintance.&rdquo; And he pointed to Colbert. &ldquo;He has been
      made but a moderately valuable servant in subaltern positions, but he will
      be a great man if I raise him to the foremost rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; stammered Colbert, confused with pleasure and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always understood why,&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan in the king&rsquo;s ear; &ldquo;he was
      jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, and his jealousy confined his wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will henceforward be a winged-serpent,&rdquo; grumbled the musketeer, with a
      remnant of hatred against his recent adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Colbert, approaching him, offered to his eyes a physiognomy so
      different from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear; he
      appeared so good, so mild, so easy; his eyes took the expression of an
      intelligence so noble, that D&rsquo;Artagnan, a connoisseur in physiognomies,
      was moved, and almost changed in his convictions. Colbert pressed his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which the king has just told you, monsieur, proves how well his
      majesty is acquainted with men. The inveterate opposition I have
      displayed, up to this day, against abuses and not against men, proves that
      I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign, for my country a
      great blessing. I have many ideas, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan. You will see them expand
      in the sun of public peace; and if I have not the good fortune to conquer
      the friendship of honest men, I am at least certain, monsieur, that I
      shall obtain their esteem. For their admiration, monsieur, I would give my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This change, this sudden elevation, this mute approbation of the king,
      gave the musketeer matter for profound reflection. He bowed civilly to
      Colbert, who did not take his eyes off him. The king, when he saw they
      were reconciled, dismissed them. They left the room together. As soon as
      they were out of the cabinet, the new minister, stopping the captain,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, that with such an eye as yours, you did
      not, at the first glance, at the first impression, discover what sort of
      man I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Colbert,&rdquo; replied the musketeer, &ldquo;a ray of the sun in our eyes
      prevents us from seeing the most vivid flame. The man in power radiates,
      you know; and since you are there, why should you continue to persecute
      him who had just fallen into disgrace, and fallen from such a height?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, monsieur!&rdquo; said Colbert; &ldquo;oh, monsieur! I would never persecute him. I
      wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone, because I
      am ambitious, and, above all, because I have the most entire confidence in
      my own merit; because I know that all the gold of this country will ebb
      and flow beneath my eyes, and I love to look at the king&rsquo;s gold; because,
      if I live thirty years, in thirty years not a <i>denir</i> of it will
      remain in my hands; because, with that gold, I will build granaries,
      castles, cities, and harbors; because I will create a marine, I will equip
      navies that shall waft the name of France to the most distant people;
      because I will create libraries and academies; because I will make France
      the first country in the world, and the wealthiest. These are the motives
      for my animosity against M. Fouquet, who prevented my acting. And then,
      when I shall be great and strong, when France is great and strong, in my
      turn, then, will I cry, &lsquo;Mercy&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, did you say? then ask his liberty of the king. The king is only
      crushing him on <i>your</i> account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert again raised his head. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know that is not
      so, and that the king has his own personal animosity against M. Fouquet;
      it is not for me to teach you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the king will grow tired; he will forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king never forgets, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan. Hark! the king calls. He is going
      to issue an order. I have not influenced him, have I? Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, in fact, was calling his secretaries. &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give twenty of your musketeers to M. de Saint-Aignan, to form a guard for
      M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan and Colbert exchanged looks. &ldquo;And from Angers,&rdquo; continued the
      king, &ldquo;they will conduct the prisoner to the Bastile, in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; said the captain to the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Aignan,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;you will have any one shot who shall
      attempt to speak privately with M. Fouquet, during the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But myself, sire,&rdquo; said the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, monsieur, you will only speak to him in the presence of the
      musketeers.&rdquo; The duke bowed and departed to execute his commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was about to retire likewise; but the king stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you will go immediately, and take possession of the
      isle and fief of Belle-Ile-en-Mer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take a sufficient number of troops to prevent delay, in case the
      place should be contumacious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of courtly incredulity rose from the group of courtiers. &ldquo;That
      shall be done,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the place in my infancy,&rdquo; resumed the king, &ldquo;and I do not wish to
      see it again. You have heard me? Go, monsieur, and do not return without
      the keys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert went up to D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;A commission which, if you carry it out
      well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will be worth a marechal&rsquo;s baton to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you employ the words, &lsquo;if you carry it out well&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! in what respect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have friends in Belle-Isle, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan; and it is not an
      easy thing for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to
      obtain success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan hung his head in deepest thought, whilst Colbert returned to
      the king. A quarter of an hour after, the captain received the written
      order from the king, to blow up the fortress of Belle-Isle, in case of
      resistance, with power of life and death over all the inhabitants or
      refugees, and an injunction not to allow one to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colbert was right,&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;for me the baton of a marechal
      of France will cost the lives of my two friends. Only they seem to forget
      that my friends are not more stupid than the birds, and that they will not
      wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings. I will show
      them that hand so plainly, that they will have quite time enough to see
      it. Poor Porthos! Poor Aramis! No; my fortune should shall not cost your
      wings a feather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thus determined, D&rsquo;Artagnan assembled the royal army, embarked it
      at Paimboeuf, and set sail, without the loss of an unnecessary minute.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLII. Belle-Ile-en-Mer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the extremity of the mole, against which the furious sea beats at the
      evening tide, two men, holding each other by the arm, were conversing in
      an animated and expansive tone, without the possibility of any other human
      being hearing their words, borne away, as they were, one by one, by the
      gusts of wind, with the white foam swept from the crests of the waves. The
      sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned ocean, like a
      gigantic crucible. From time to time, one of these men, turning towards
      the east, cast an anxious, inquiring look over the sea. The other,
      interrogating the features of his companion, seemed to seek for
      information in his looks. Then, both silent, busied with dismal thoughts,
      they resumed their walk. Every one has already perceived that these two
      men were our proscribed heroes, Porthos and Aramis, who had taken refuge
      in Belle-Isle, since the ruin of their hopes, since the discomfiture of
      the colossal schemes of M. d&rsquo;Herblay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If is of no use your saying anything to the contrary, my dear Aramis,&rdquo;
       repeated Porthos, inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he
      charged his massive chest, &ldquo;It is of no use, Aramis. The disappearance of
      all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary
      circumstance. There has been no storm at sea; the weather has been
      constantly calm, not even the lightest gale; and even if we had had a
      tempest, all our boats would not have foundered. I repeat, it is strange.
      This complete disappearance astonishes me, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; murmured Aramis. &ldquo;You are right, friend Porthos; it is true, there
      is something strange in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And further,&rdquo; added Porthos, whose ideas the assent of the bishop of
      Vannes seemed to enlarge; &ldquo;and, further, do you not observe that if the
      boats have perished, not a single plank has washed ashore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have remarked it as well as yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in
      the whole island, and which I sent in search of the others&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis here interrupted his companion by a cry, and by so sudden a
      movement, that Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied. &ldquo;What do you say,
      Porthos? What!&mdash;You have sent the two boats&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In search of the others! Yes, to be sure I have,&rdquo; replied Porthos,
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy man! What have you done? Then we are indeed lost,&rdquo; cried the
      bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost!&mdash;what did you say?&rdquo; exclaimed the terrified Porthos. &ldquo;How
      lost, Aramis? How are we lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis bit his lips. &ldquo;Nothing! nothing! Your pardon, I meant to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That if we were inclined&mdash;if we took a fancy to make an excursion by
      sea, we could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! and why should that vex you? A precious pleasure, <i>ma foi!</i>
      For my part, I don&rsquo;t regret it at all. What I regret is certainly not the
      more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle: what I regret, Aramis,
      is Pierrefonds; Bracieux; le Vallon; beautiful France! Here, we are not in
      France, my dear friend; we are&mdash;I know not where. Oh! I tell you, in
      full sincerity of soul, and your affection will excuse my frankness, but I
      declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle. No; in good truth, I am not
      happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis breathed a long, but stifled sigh. &ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; replied he: &ldquo;that
      is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had left in
      search of the boats which disappeared two days ago. If you had not sent
      them away, we would have departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Departed!&rsquo; And the orders, Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> Why, the orders you have been constantly, in and out of
      season, repeating to me&mdash;that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the
      usurper. You know very well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true!&rdquo; murmured Aramis again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, then, plainly, my friend, that we could not depart; and that the
      sending away of the boats in search of the others cannot prove prejudicial
      to us in the very least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis was silent; and his vague glances, luminous as that of an
      albatross, hovered for a long time over the sea, interrogating space,
      seeking to pierce the very horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all that, Aramis,&rdquo; continued Porthos, who adhered to his idea, and
      that the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed it,&mdash;&ldquo;with
      all that, you give me no explanation about what can have happened to these
      unfortunate boats. I am assailed by cries and complaints whichever way I
      go. The children cry to see the desolation of the women, as if I could
      restore the absent husbands and fathers. What do you suppose, my friend,
      and how ought I to answer them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think all you like, my good Porthos, and say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reply did not satisfy Porthos at all. He turned away grumbling
      something in ill-humor. Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer. &ldquo;Do you
      remember,&rdquo; said he, in a melancholy tone, kneading the two hands of the
      giant between his own with affectionate cordiality, &ldquo;do you remember, my
      friend, that in the glorious days of youth&mdash;do you remember, Porthos,
      when we were all strong and valiant&mdash;we, and the other two&mdash;if
      we had then had an inclination to return to France, do you think this
      sheet of salt water would have stopped us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;but six leagues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had seen me get astride of a plank, would you have remained on
      land, Porthos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>pardieu!</i> No, Aramis. But, nowadays, what sort of a plank
      should we want, my friend! I, in particular.&rdquo; And the Seigneur de Bracieux
      cast a profound glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh. &ldquo;And
      do you mean seriously to say you are not tired of Belle-Isle a little, and
      that you would not prefer the comforts of your dwelling&mdash;of your
      episcopal palace, at Vannes? Come, confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Aramis, without daring to look at Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us stay where we are, then,&rdquo; said his friend, with a sigh, which, in
      spite of the efforts he made to restrain it, escaped his echoing breast.
      &ldquo;Let us remain!&mdash;let us remain! And yet,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;and yet, if we
      seriously wished, but that decidedly&mdash;if we had a fixed idea, one
      firmly taken, to return to France, and there were not boats&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you remarked another thing, my friend&mdash;that is, since the
      disappearance of our barks, during the last two days&rsquo; absence of
      fishermen, not a single small boat has landed on the shores of the isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly! you are right. I, too, have remarked it, and the
      observation was the more naturally made, for, before the last two fatal
      days, barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must inquire,&rdquo; said Aramis, suddenly, and with great agitation. &ldquo;And
      then, if we had a raft constructed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are some canoes, my friend; shall I board one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A canoe!&mdash;a canoe! Can you think of such a thing, Porthos? A canoe
      to be upset in. No, no,&rdquo; said the bishop of Vannes; &ldquo;it is not our trade
      to ride upon the waves. We will wait, we will wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Aramis continued walking about with increased agitation. Porthos, who
      grew tired of following all the feverish movements of his friend&mdash;Porthos,
      who in his faith and calmness understood nothing of the sort of
      exasperation which was betrayed by his companion&rsquo;s continual convulsive
      starts&mdash;Porthos stopped him. &ldquo;Let us sit down upon this rock,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Place yourself there, close to me, Aramis, and I conjure you, for the
      last time, to explain to me in a manner I can comprehend&mdash;explain to
      me what we are doing here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos,&rdquo; said Aramis, much embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that the false king wished to dethrone the true king. That is a
      fact, that I understand. Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that the false king formed the project of selling Belle-Isle to
      the English. I understand that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that we engineers and captains came and threw ourselves into
      Belle-Isle to take direction of the works, and the command of ten
      companies levied and paid by M. Fouquet, or rather the ten companies of
      his son-in-law. All that is plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis rose in a state of great impatience. He might be said to be a lion
      importuned by a gnat. Porthos held him by the arm. &ldquo;But what I cannot
      understand, what, in spite of all the efforts of my mind, and all my
      reflections, I cannot comprehend, and never shall comprehend, is, that
      instead of sending us troops, instead of sending us reinforcements of men,
      munitions, provisions, they leave us without boats, they leave Belle-Isle
      without arrivals, without help; it is that instead of establishing with us
      a correspondence, whether by signals, or written or verbal communications,
      all relations with the shore are intercepted. Tell me, Aramis, answer me,
      or rather, before answering me, will you allow me to tell you what I have
      thought? Will you hear what my idea is, the plan I have conceived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop raised his head. &ldquo;Well! Aramis,&rdquo; continued Porthos, &ldquo;I have
      dreamed, I have imagined that an event has taken place in France. I dreamt
      of M. Fouquet all the night, of lifeless fish, of broken eggs, of chambers
      badly furnished, meanly kept. Villainous dreams, my dear D&rsquo;Herblay; very
      unlucky, such dreams!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos, what is that yonder?&rdquo; interrupted Aramis, rising suddenly, and
      pointing out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bark!&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;yes, it is a bark! Ah! we shall have some news at
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two!&rdquo; cried the bishop, on discovering another mast; &ldquo;two!
      three! four!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five!&rdquo; said Porthos, in his turn. &ldquo;Six! seven! Ah! <i>mon Dieu! mon Dieu!</i>
      it is a fleet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our boats returning, probably,&rdquo; said Aramis, very uneasily, in spite of
      the assurance he affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very large for fishing-boats,&rdquo; observed Porthos, &ldquo;and do you not
      remark, my friend, that they come from the Loire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They come from the Loire&mdash;yes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And look! everybody here sees them as well as ourselves; look, women and
      children are beginning to crowd the jetty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An old fisherman passed. &ldquo;Are those our barks, yonder?&rdquo; asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked steadily into the eye of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;they are lighter boars, boats in the
      king&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boats in the royal service?&rdquo; replied Aramis, starting. &ldquo;How do you know
      that?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the flag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;the boat is scarcely visible; how the devil, my
      friend, can you distinguish the flag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see there is one,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;our boats, trade lighters, do
      not carry any. That sort of craft is generally used for transport of
      troops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; groaned Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Vivat!</i>&rdquo; cried Porthos, &ldquo;they are sending us reinforcements, don&rsquo;t
      you think they are, Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless it is the English coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Loire? That would have an evil look, Porthos; for they must have
      come through Paris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; they are reinforcements, decidedly, or provisions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis leaned his head upon his hands, and made no reply. Then, all at
      once,&mdash;&ldquo;Porthos,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have the alarm sounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The alarm! do you imagine such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and let the cannoniers mount their batteries, the artillerymen be at
      their pieces, and be particularly watchful of the coast batteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos opened his eyes to their widest extent. He looked attentively at
      his friend, to convince himself he was in his proper senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> will do it, my dear Porthos,&rdquo; continued Aramis, in his blandest
      tone; &ldquo;I will go and have these orders executed myself, if you do not go,
      my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I will&mdash;instantly!&rdquo; said Porthos, who went to execute the
      orders, casting all the while looks behind him, to see if the bishop of
      Vannes were not deceived; and if, on recovering more rational ideas, he
      would not recall him. The alarm was sounded, trumpets brayed, drums
      rolled; the great bronze bell swung in horror from its lofty belfry. The
      dikes and moles were quickly filled with the curious and soldiers; matches
      sparkled in the hands of the artillerymen, placed behind the large cannon
      bedded in their stone carriages. When every man was at his post, when all
      the preparations for defense were made: &ldquo;Permit me, Aramis, to try to
      comprehend,&rdquo; whispered Porthos, timidly, in Aramis&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, you will comprehend but too soon,&rdquo; murmured M. d&rsquo;Herblay,
      in reply to this question of his lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fleet which is coming yonder, with sails unfurled, straight towards
      the port of Belle-Isle, is a royal fleet, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as there are two kings in France, Porthos, to which of these two
      kings does this fleet belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you open my eyes,&rdquo; replied the giant, stunned by the insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Porthos, whose eyes this reply of his friend&rsquo;s had at last opened, or
      rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight, went with his best
      speed to the batteries to overlook his people, and exhort every one to do
      his duty. In the meantime, Aramis, with his eye fixed on the horizon, saw
      the ships continually drawing nearer. The people and the soldiers, perched
      on the summits of the rocks, could distinguish the masts, then the lower
      sails, and at last the hulls of the lighters, bearing at the masthead the
      royal flag of France. It was night when one of these vessels, which had
      created such a sensation among the inhabitants of Belle-Isle, dropped
      anchor within cannon shot of the place. It was soon seen, notwithstanding
      the darkness, that some sort of agitation reigned on board the vessel,
      from the side of which a skiff was lowered, of which the three rowers,
      bending to their oars, took the direction of the port, and in a few
      instants struck land at the foot of the fort. The commander jumped ashore.
      He had a letter in his hand, which he waved in the air, and seemed to wish
      to communicate with somebody. This man was soon recognized by several
      soldiers as one of the pilots of the island. He was the captain of one of
      the two barks retained by Aramis, but which Porthos, in his anxiety with
      regard to the fate of the fishermen who had disappeared, had sent in
      search of the missing boats. He asked to be conducted to M. d&rsquo;Herblay. Two
      soldiers, at a signal from a sergeant, marched him between them, and
      escorted him. Aramis was upon the quay. The envoy presented himself before
      the bishop of Vannes. The darkness was almost absolute, notwithstanding
      the flambeaux borne at a small distance by the soldiers who were following
      Aramis in his rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jonathan, from whom do you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, from those who captured me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who captured you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! monseigneur, within a short league we were captured by a <i>chasse
      maree</i> belonging to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of which king?&rdquo; cried Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonathan started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; continued the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were captured, monseigneur, and joined to those who had been taken
      yesterday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the cause of the mania for capturing you all?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, to prevent us from telling you,&rdquo; replied Jonathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos was again at a loss to comprehend. &ldquo;And they have released you
      to-day?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I might tell you they have captured us, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble upon trouble,&rdquo; thought honest Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Aramis was reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the
      coasts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who commands it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain of the king&rsquo;s musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; exclaimed Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that is the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he give you this letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring the torches nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his writing,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis eagerly read the following lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order of the king to take Belle-Isle; or to put the garrison to the
      sword, if they resist; order to make prisoners of all the men of the
      garrison; signed, D&rsquo;ARTAGNAN, who, the day before yesterday, arrested M.
      Fouquet, for the purpose of his being sent to the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis turned pale, and crushed the paper in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my friend, nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Jonathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak to M. d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That for ampler information, he would speak with monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On board his own vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On board his vessel!&rdquo; and Porthos repeated, &ldquo;On board his vessel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le mousquetaire,&rdquo; continued Jonathan, &ldquo;told me to take you both on
      board my canoe, and bring you to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go at once,&rdquo; exclaimed Porthos. &ldquo;Dear D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aramis stopped him. &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Who knows that it is not
      a snare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the other king&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said Porthos, mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A snare, in fact! That&rsquo;s what it is, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly; what is to be done, then? If D&rsquo;Artagnan sends for us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who assures you that D&rsquo;Artagnan sends for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;but his writing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writing is easily counterfeited. This looks counterfeited&mdash;unsteady&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always right; but, in the meantime, we know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the good Porthos, &ldquo;we do not want to know anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; asked Jonathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will return on board this captain&rsquo;s vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I comprehend!&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Jonathan; &ldquo;but if the captain should refuse to
      come to Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he refuses, as we have cannon, we will make use of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! against D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is D&rsquo;Artagnan, Porthos, he will come. Go, Jonathan, go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> I no longer comprehend anything,&rdquo; murmured Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make you comprehend it all, my dear friend; the time for it has
      come; sit down upon this gun-carriage, open your ears, and listen well to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>pardieu!</i> I will listen, no fear of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I depart, monseigneur?&rdquo; cried Jonathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, begone, and bring back an answer. Allow the canoe to pass, you men
      there!&rdquo; And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis took Porthos by the hand, and commenced his explanations.

      Chapter XLIII. Explanations by Aramis.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have to say to you, friend Porthos, will probably surprise you,
      but it may prove instructive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to be surprised,&rdquo; said Porthos, in a kindly tone; &ldquo;do not spare
      me, therefore, I beg. I am hardened against emotions; don&rsquo;t fear, speak
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult, Porthos&mdash;difficult; for, in truth, I warn you a
      second time, I have very strange things, very extraordinary things, to
      tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you speak so well, my friend, that I could listen to you for days
      together. Speak, then, I beg&mdash;and&mdash;stop, I have an idea: I will,
      to make your task more easy, I will, to assist you in telling me such
      things, question you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be pleased at your doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to fight for, Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ask me many such questions as that&mdash;if you would render my
      task the easier by interrupting my revelations thus, Porthos, you will not
      help me at all. So far, on the contrary, that is the very Gordian knot.
      But, my friend, with a man like you, good, generous, and devoted, the
      confession must be bravely made. I have deceived you, my worthy friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have deceived me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it for my good, Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so, Porthos; I thought so sincerely, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the honest seigneur of Bracieux, &ldquo;you have rendered me a
      service, and I thank you for it; for if you had not deceived me, I might
      have deceived myself. In what, then, have you deceived me, tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV., at this
      moment, is directing his efforts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The usurper!&rdquo; said Porthos, scratching his head. &ldquo;That is&mdash;well, I
      do not quite clearly comprehend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is one of the two kings who are contending for the crown of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Then you were serving him who is not Louis XIV.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have hit the matter in one word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It follows that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It follows that we are rebels, my poor friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil! the devil!&rdquo; cried Porthos, much disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but, dear Porthos, be calm, we shall still find means of getting out
      of the affair, trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that which makes me uneasy,&rdquo; replied Porthos; &ldquo;that which alone
      touches me is that ugly word <i>rebels</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, according to this, the duchy that was promised me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the usurper that was to give it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not the same thing, Aramis,&rdquo; said Porthos, majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, if it had only depended upon me, you should have become a
      prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where you have been wrong,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;in deceiving me; for
      that promised duchy I reckoned upon. Oh! I reckoned upon it seriously,
      knowing you to be a man of your word, Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Porthos! pardon me, I implore you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then,&rdquo; continued Porthos, without replying to the bishop&rsquo;s prayer,
      &ldquo;so then, it seems, I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I will settle all that, my good friend, I will settle all that. I
      will take it on myself alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Porthos, I conjure you, let me act. No false generosity! No
      inopportune devotedness! You knew nothing of my projects. You have done
      nothing of yourself. With me it is different. I alone am the author of
      this plot. I stood in need of my inseparable companion; I called upon you,
      and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device, &lsquo;All for one, one
      for all.&rsquo; My crime is that I was an egotist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that is a word I like,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;and seeing that you have
      acted entirely for yourself, it is impossible for me to blame you. It is
      natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And upon this sublime reflection, Porthos pressed his friend&rsquo;s hand
      cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul, Aramis felt his own
      littleness. It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before
      real superiority of heart, which is more imposing than brilliancy of mind.
      He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;that we have come to an explanation, now that I am
      perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV., I think, my
      friend, it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which
      we are the victims&mdash;for I plainly see there is a political intrigue
      at the bottom of all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan, my good Porthos, D&rsquo;Artagnan is coming, and will detail it to
      you in all its circumstances; but, excuse me, I am deeply grieved, I am
      bowed down with mental anguish, and I have need of all my presence of
      mind, all my powers of reflection, to extricate you from the false
      position in which I have so imprudently involved you; but nothing can be
      more clear, nothing more plain, than your position, henceforth. The king
      Louis XIV. has no longer now but one enemy: that enemy is myself, myself
      alone. I have made you a prisoner, you have followed me, to-day I liberate
      you, you fly back to your prince. You can perceive, Porthos, there is not
      one difficulty in all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; said the admirable good sense of Porthos, &ldquo;then why, if we are
      in such an easy position, why, my friend, do we prepare cannon, muskets,
      and engines of all sorts? It seems to me it would be much more simple to
      say to Captain d&rsquo;Artagnan: &lsquo;My dear friend, we have been mistaken; that
      error is to be repaired; open the door to us, let us pass through, and we
      will say good-bye.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that!&rdquo; said Aramis, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;that&rsquo;? Do you not approve of my plan, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a difficulty in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hypothesis that D&rsquo;Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige us
      to defend ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! defend ourselves against D&rsquo;Artagnan? Folly! Against the good
      D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis once more replied by shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos,&rdquo; at length said he, &ldquo;if I have had the matches lighted and the
      guns pointed, if I have had the signal of alarm sounded, if I have called
      every man to his post upon the ramparts, those good ramparts of Belle-Isle
      which you have so well fortified, it was not for nothing. Wait to judge;
      or rather, no, do not wait&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I knew, my friend, I would have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves:&mdash;a
      boat, and away for France&mdash;where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Aramis, smiling with a strong shade of sadness, &ldquo;do
      not let us reason like children; let us be men in council and in
      execution.&mdash;But, hark! I hear a hail for landing at the port.
      Attention, Porthos, serious attention!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is D&rsquo;Artagnan, no doubt,&rdquo; said Porthos, in a voice of thunder,
      approaching the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is I,&rdquo; replied the captain of the musketeers, running lightly up
      the steps of the mole, and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on which
      his two friends waited for him. As soon as he came towards them, Porthos
      and Aramis observed an officer who followed D&rsquo;Artagnan, treading
      apparently in his very steps. The captain stopped upon the stairs of the
      mole, when half-way up. His companions imitated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your men draw back,&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis; &ldquo;let
      them retire out of hearing.&rdquo; This order, given by Porthos, was executed
      immediately. Then D&rsquo;Artagnan, turning towards him who followed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are no longer on board the king&rsquo;s fleet, where,
      in virtue of your order, you spoke so arrogantly to me, just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the officer, &ldquo;I did not speak arrogantly to you; I
      simply, but rigorously, obeyed instructions. I was commanded to follow
      you. I follow you. I am directed not to allow you to communicate with any
      one without taking cognizance of what you do; I am in duty bound,
      accordingly, to overhear your conversations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan trembled with rage, and Porthos and Aramis, who heard this
      dialogue, trembled likewise, but with uneasiness and fear. D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      biting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him exasperation,
      closely to be followed by an explosion, approached the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, so much the more impressive, that,
      affecting calm, it threatened tempest&mdash;&ldquo;monsieur, when I sent a canoe
      hither, you wished to know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle.
      You produced an order to that effect; and, in my turn, I instantly showed
      you the note I had written. When the skipper of the boat sent by me
      returned, when I received the reply of these two gentlemen&rdquo; (and he
      pointed to Aramis and Porthos), &ldquo;you heard every word of what the
      messenger said. All that was plainly in your orders, all that was well
      executed, very punctually, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; stammered the officer; &ldquo;yes, without doubt, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, growing warm&mdash;&ldquo;monsieur, when I
      manifested the intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle, you
      demanded to accompany me; I did not hesitate; I brought you with me. You
      are now at Belle-Isle, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;the question no longer is of M. Colbert, who has given you that
      order, or of whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions;
      the question now is of a man who is a clog upon M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, and who is
      alone with M. d&rsquo;Artagnan upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty feet
      of salt water; a bad position for that man, a bad position, monsieur! I
      warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, if I am a restraint upon you,&rdquo; said the officer, timidly,
      and almost faintly, &ldquo;it is my duty which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, you have had the misfortune, either you or those that sent you,
      to insult me. It is done. I cannot seek redress from those who employ you,&mdash;they
      are unknown to me, or are at too great a distance. But you are under my
      hand, and I swear that if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet
      to go up to those gentlemen, I swear to you by my name, I will cleave your
      head in two with my sword, and pitch you into the water. Oh! it will
      happen! it will happen! I have only been six times angry in my life,
      monsieur, and all five preceding times <i>I killed my man</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer did not stir; he became pale under this terrible threat, but
      replied with simplicity, &ldquo;Monsieur, you are wrong in acting against my
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos and Aramis, mute and trembling at the top of the parapet, cried to
      the musketeer, &ldquo;Good D&rsquo;Artagnan, take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence, raised his foot with ominous
      calmness to mount the stair, and turned round, sword in hand, to see if
      the officer followed him. The officer made a sign of the cross and stepped
      up. Porthos and Aramis, who knew their D&rsquo;Artagnan, uttered a cry, and
      rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already heard. But
      D&rsquo;Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he to the officer, in an agitated voice, &ldquo;you are a brave
      man. You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to you
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, speak,&rdquo; replied the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gentlemen we have just seen, and against whom you have orders, are
      my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they are, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your
      instructions prescribe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; permit me, then, to converse with them without a witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, if I yield to your request, if I do that which you
      beg me, I break my word; but if I do not do it, I disoblige you. I prefer
      the one dilemma to the other. Converse with your friends, and do not
      despise me, monsieur, for doing this for <i>your</i> sake, whom I esteem
      and honor; do not despise me for committing for you, and you alone, an
      unworthy act.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan, much agitated, threw his arm round the neck of
      the young man, and then went up to his friends. The officer, enveloped in
      his cloak, sat down on the damp, weed-covered steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan to his friends, &ldquo;such is my position, judge for
      yourselves.&rdquo; All three embraced as in the glorious days of their youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of all these preparations?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have a suspicion of what they signify,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any, I assure you, my dear captain; for, in fact, I have done
      nothing, no more has Aramis,&rdquo; the worthy baron hastened to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate, which penetrated that
      hardened heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Porthos!&rdquo; cried the bishop of Vannes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what is being done against you,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;interception
      of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle. Your means of transport
      seized. If you had endeavored to fly, you would have fallen into the hands
      of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions, on the watch for you.
      The king wants you to be taken, and he will take you.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan tore at
      his gray mustache. Aramis grew somber, Porthos angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea was this,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan: &ldquo;to make you both come on board,
      to keep you near me, and restore you your liberty. But now, who can say,
      when I return to my ship, I may not find a superior; that I may not find
      secret orders which will take from me my command, and give it to another,
      who will dispose of me and you without hope of help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must remain at Belle-Isle,&rdquo; said Aramis, resolutely; &ldquo;and I assure
      you, for my part, I will not surrender easily.&rdquo; Porthos said nothing.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have another trial to make of this officer, of this brave fellow who
      accompanies me, and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy; for
      it denotes an honest man, who, though an enemy, is a thousand times better
      than a complaisant coward. Let us try to learn from him what his
      instructions are, and what his orders permit or forbid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us try,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan went to the parapet, leaned over towards the steps of the mole,
      and called the officer, who immediately came up. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural between
      gentlemen who know and appreciate each other, &ldquo;monsieur, if I wished to
      take away these gentlemen from here, what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not oppose it, monsieur; but having direct explicit orders to
      put them under guard, I should detain them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; said Aramis, gloomily. Porthos did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still take Porthos,&rdquo; said the bishop of Vannes. &ldquo;He can prove to the
      king, and I will help him do so, and you too, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, that he
      had nothing to do with this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Will you come? Will you follow me, Porthos? The
      king is merciful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want time for reflection,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remain here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until fresh orders,&rdquo; said Aramis, with vivacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until we have an idea,&rdquo; resumed D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;and I now believe that will
      not be long, for I have one already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us say adieu, then,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;but in truth, my good Porthos, you
      ought to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the latter, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied Aramis, a little wounded in his susceptibilities
      at the morose tone of his companion. &ldquo;Only I am reassured by the promise
      of an idea from D&rsquo;Artagnan, an idea I fancy I have divined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; said the musketeer, placing his ear near Aramis&rsquo;s mouth. The
      latter spoke several words rapidly, to which D&rsquo;Artagnan replied, &ldquo;That is
      it, precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infallible!&rdquo; cried Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the first emotion this resolution will cause, take care of
      yourself, Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, monsieur,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan to the officer, &ldquo;thanks, a thousand
      thanks! You have made yourself three friends for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Aramis. Porthos alone said nothing, but merely bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, having tenderly embraced his two old friends, left Belle-Isle
      with the inseparable companion with whom M. Colbert had saddled him. Thus,
      with the exception of the explanation with which the worthy Porthos had
      been willing to be satisfied, nothing had changed in appearance in the
      fate of one or the other, &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;there is D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan did not return on board without profoundly analyzing the idea
      he had discovered. Now, we know that whatever D&rsquo;Artagnan did examine,
      according to custom, daylight was certain to illuminate. As to the
      officer, now grown mute again, he had full time for meditation. Therefore,
      on putting his foot on board his vessel, moored within cannon-shot of the
      island, the captain of the musketeers had already got together all his
      means, offensive and defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He immediately assembled his council, which consisted of the officers
      serving under his orders. These were eight in number; a chief of the
      maritime forces; a major directing the artillery; an engineer, the officer
      we are acquainted with, and four lieutenants. Having assembled them,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan arose, took of his hat, and addressed them thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I have been to reconnoiter Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and I have found
      in it a good and solid garrison; moreover, preparations are made for a
      defense that may prove troublesome. I therefore intend to send for two of
      the principal officers of the place, that we may converse with them.
      Having separated them from their troops and cannon, we shall be better
      able to deal with them; particularly by reasoning with them. Is not this
      your opinion, gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major of artillery rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, with respect, but firmness, &ldquo;I have heard you say
      that the place is preparing to make a troublesome defense. The place is
      then, as you know, determined on rebellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was visibly put out by this reply; but he was not the man to
      allow himself to be subdued by a trifle, and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your reply is just. But you are ignorant that
      Belle-Isle is a fief of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s, and that former monarchs gave the
      right to the seigneurs of Belle-Isle to arm their people.&rdquo; The major made
      a movement. &ldquo;Oh! do not interrupt me,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;You are
      going to tell me that that right to arm themselves against the English was
      not a right to arm themselves against their king. But it is not M.
      Fouquet, I suppose, who holds Belle-Isle at this moment, since I arrested
      M. Fouquet the day before yesterday. Now the inhabitants and defenders of
      Belle-Isle know nothing of this arrest. You would announce it to them in
      vain. It is a thing so unheard-of and extraordinary, so unexpected, that
      they would not believe you. A Breton serves his master, and not his
      masters; he serves his master till he has seen him dead. Now the Bretons,
      as far as I know, have not seen the body of M. Fouquet. It is not, then,
      surprising they hold out against that which is neither M. Fouquet nor his
      signature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major bowed in token of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I propose to cause two of the
      principal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel. They will
      see you, gentlemen; they will see the forces we have at our disposal; they
      will consequently know to what they have to trust, and the fate that
      attends them, in case of rebellion. We will affirm to them, upon our
      honor, that M. Fouquet is a prisoner, and that all resistance can only be
      prejudicial to them. We will tell them that at the first cannon fired,
      there will be no further hope of mercy from the king. Then, or so at least
      I trust, they will resist no longer. They will yield up without fighting,
      and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way which it might
      cost prodigious efforts to subdue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer who had followed D&rsquo;Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to
      speak, but D&rsquo;Artagnan interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know what you are going to tell me, monsieur; I know that there is
      an order of the king&rsquo;s to prevent all secret communications with the
      defenders of Belle-Isle, and that is exactly why I do not offer to
      communicate except in presence of my staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And D&rsquo;Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers, who knew
      him well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers looked at each other as if to read each other&rsquo;s opinions in
      their eyes, with the intention of evidently acting, should they agree,
      according to the desire of D&rsquo;Artagnan. And already the latter saw with joy
      that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to Porthos and
      Aramis, when the king&rsquo;s officer drew from a pocket a folded paper, which
      he placed in the hands of D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper bore upon its superscription the number 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, more!&rdquo; murmured the surprised captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read, monsieur,&rdquo; said the officer, with a courtesy that was not free from
      sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, full of mistrust, unfolded the paper, and read these words:
      &ldquo;Prohibition to M. d&rsquo;Artagnan to assemble any council whatever, or to
      deliberate in any way before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners
      shot. Signed&mdash;LOUIS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole
      body, and with a gracious smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well, monsieur,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s orders shall be complied
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIV. Result of the Ideas of the King, and the Ideas of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The blow was direct. It was severe, mortal. D&rsquo;Artagnan, furious at having
      been anticipated by an idea of the king&rsquo;s, did not despair, however, even
      yet; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from Belle-Isle, he
      elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, suddenly, &ldquo;since the king has charged some other
      than myself with his secret orders, it must be because I no longer possess
      his confidence, and I should really be unworthy of it if I had the courage
      to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions. Therefore I
      will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king. I tender it
      before you all, enjoining you all to fall back with me upon the coast of
      France, in such a way as not to compromise the safety of the forces his
      majesty has confided to me. For this purpose, return all to your posts;
      within an hour, we shall have the ebb of the tide. To your posts,
      gentlemen! I suppose,&rdquo; added he, on seeing that all prepared to obey him,
      except the surveillant officer, &ldquo;you have no orders to object, this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And D&rsquo;Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words. This plan
      would prove the safety of his friends. The blockade once raised, they
      might embark immediately, and set sail for England or Spain, without fear
      of being molested. Whilst they were making their escape, D&rsquo;Artagnan would
      return to the king; would justify his return by the indignation which the
      mistrust of Colbert had raised in him; he would be sent back with full
      powers, and he would take Belle-Isle; that is to say, the cage, after the
      birds had flown. But to this plan the officer opposed a further order of
      the king&rsquo;s. It was thus conceived:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the moment M. d&rsquo;Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of giving
      in his resignation, he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the
      expedition, and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to no
      longer obey him. Moreover, the said Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, having lost that
      quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle, shall set out
      immediately for France, accompanied by the officer who will have remitted
      the message to him, and who will consider him a prisoner for whom he is
      answerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brave and careless as he was, D&rsquo;Artagnan turned pale. Everything had been
      calculated with a depth of precognition which, for the first time in
      thirty years, recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible logic of
      the great cardinal. He leaned his head on his hand, thoughtful, scarcely
      breathing. &ldquo;If I were to put this order in my pocket,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;who
      would know it, what would prevent my doing it? Before the king had had
      time to be informed, I should have saved those poor fellows yonder. Let us
      exercise some small audacity! My head is not one of those the executioner
      strikes off for disobedience. We will disobey!&rdquo; But at the moment he was
      about to adopt this plan, he saw the officers around him reading similar
      orders, which the passive agent of the thoughts of that infernal Colbert
      had distributed to them. This contingency of his disobedience had been
      foreseen&mdash;as all the rest had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the officer, coming up to him, &ldquo;I await your good
      pleasure to depart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready, monsieur,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, grinding his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d&rsquo;Artagnan and
      himself. At sight of this he became almost distraught with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How,&rdquo; stammered he, &ldquo;will you carry on the directions of the different
      corps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are gone, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the commander of the fleet, &ldquo;it is
      to me the command of the whole is committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, monsieur,&rdquo; rejoined Colbert&rsquo;s man, addressing the new leader, &ldquo;it
      is for you that this last order remitted to me is intended. Let us see
      your powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; said the officer, exhibiting the royal signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your instructions,&rdquo; replied the officer, placing the folded
      paper in his hands; and turning round towards D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;Come,
      monsieur,&rdquo; said he, in an agitated voice (such despair did he behold in
      that man of iron), &ldquo;do me the favor to depart at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately!&rdquo; articulated D&rsquo;Artagnan, feebly, subdued, crushed by
      implacable impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he painfully subsided into the little boat, which started, favored by
      wind and tide, for the coast of France. The king&rsquo;s guards embarked with
      him. The musketeer still preserved the hope of reaching Nantes quickly,
      and of pleading the cause of his friends eloquently enough to incline the
      king to mercy. The bark flew like a swallow. D&rsquo;Artagnan distinctly saw the
      land of France profiled in black against the white clouds of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, to the officer to whom, for an
      hour, he had ceased speaking, &ldquo;what would I give to know the instructions
      for the new commander! They are all pacific, are they not? and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish; the thunder of a distant cannon rolled athwart the
      waves, another, and two or three still louder. D&rsquo;Artagnan shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have commenced the siege of Belle-Isle,&rdquo; replied the officer. The
      canoe had just touched the soil of France.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XLV. The Ancestors of Porthos.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When D&rsquo;Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos, the latter returned to the
      principal fort, in order to converse with greater liberty. Porthos, still
      thoughtful, was a restraint on Aramis, whose mind had never felt itself
      more free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Porthos,&rdquo; said he, suddenly, &ldquo;I will explain D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s idea to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What idea, Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! indeed!&rdquo; said Porthos, much astonished. &ldquo;Let us hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you remark, in the scene our friend had with the officer, that
      certain orders constrained him with regard to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did notice that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! D&rsquo;Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king, and
      during the confusion that will result from his absence, we will get away,
      or rather you will get away, Porthos, if there is possibility of flight
      for only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Porthos shook his head and replied: &ldquo;We will escape together, Aramis,
      or we will stay together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thine is a right, a generous heart,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;only your melancholy
      uneasiness affects me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not uneasy,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are angry with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not angry with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why, my friend, do you put on such a dismal countenance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you; I am making my will.&rdquo; And while saying these words, the
      good Porthos looked sadly in the face of Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your will!&rdquo; cried the bishop. &ldquo;What, then! do you think yourself lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel fatigued. It is the first time, and there is a custom in our
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;then your grandfather must have been Samson
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; his name was Antoine. Well! he was about my age, when, setting out
      one day for the chase, he felt his legs weak, the man who had never known
      what weakness was before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing good, as you will see; for having set out, complaining still of
      weakness of the legs, he met a wild boar, which made head against him; he
      missed him with his arquebuse, and was ripped up by the beast and died
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself, dear Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you will see. My father was as strong again as I am. He was a rough
      soldier, under Henry III. and Henry IV.; his name was not Antoine, but
      Gaspard, the same as M. de Coligny. Always on horseback, he had never
      known what lassitude was. One evening, as he rose from table, his legs
      failed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had supped heartily, perhaps,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;and that was why he
      staggered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! A friend of M. de Bassompierre, nonsense! No, no, he was astonished
      at this lassitude, and said to my mother, who laughed at him, &lsquo;Would not
      one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar, as the late M. du
      Vallon, my father did?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, having this weakness, my father insisted upon going down into the
      garden, instead of going to bed; his foot slipped on the first stair, the
      staircase was steep; my father fell against a stone in which an iron hinge
      was fixed. The hinge gashed his temple; and he was stretched out dead upon
      the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis raised his eyes to his friend: &ldquo;These are two extraordinary
      circumstances,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;let us not infer that there may succeed a third.
      It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious, my brave
      Porthos. Besides, when were your legs known to fail? Never have you stood
      so firm, so haughtily; why, you could carry a house on your shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;I feel myself pretty active; but at times
      I vacillate; I sink; and lately this phenomenon, as you say, has occurred
      four times. I will not say this frightens me, but it annoys me. Life is an
      agreeable thing. I have money; I have fine estates; I have horses that I
      love; I have also friends that I love: D&rsquo;Artagnan, Athos, Raoul, and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in the
      very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship. Aramis
      pressed his hand: &ldquo;We will still live many years,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to preserve
      to the world such specimens of its rarest men. Trust yourself to me, my
      friend; we have no reply from D&rsquo;Artagnan, that is a good sign. He must
      have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the seas. On my
      part I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers
      to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria, which you know, where we
      have so often lain in wait for the foxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we
      discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. In case of misfortunes, a bark is to be concealed for us in
      that cavern; indeed, it must be there by this time. We will wait for a
      favorable moment, and during the night we will go to sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a grand idea. What shall we gain by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall gain this&mdash;nobody knows that grotto, or rather its issue,
      except ourselves and two or three hunters of the island; we shall gain
      this&mdash;that if the island is occupied, the scouts, seeing no bark upon
      the shore, will never imagine we can escape, and will cease to watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! that weakness in the legs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! better, much, just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, then, plainly, that everything conspires to give us quietude and
      hope. D&rsquo;Artagnan will sweep the sea and leave us free. No royal fleet or
      descent to be dreaded. <i>Vive Dieu!</i> Porthos, we have still half a
      century of magnificent adventure before us, and if I once touch Spanish
      ground, I swear to you,&rdquo; added the bishop with terrible energy, &ldquo;that your
      brevet of duke is not such a chance as it is said to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live by hope,&rdquo; said Porthos, enlivened by the warmth of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once a cry resounded in their ears: &ldquo;To arms! to arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This cry, repeated by a hundred throats, piercing the chamber where the
      two friends were conversing, carried surprise to one, and uneasiness to
      the other. Aramis opened the window; he saw a crowd of people running with
      flambeaux. Women were seeking places of safety, the armed population were
      hastening to their posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fleet! the fleet!&rdquo; cried a soldier, who recognized Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fleet?&rdquo; repeated the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within half cannon-shot,&rdquo; continued the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; cried Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; repeated Porthos, formidably. And both rushed forth towards the
      mole to place themselves within the shelter of the batteries. Boats, laden
      with soldiers, were seen approaching; and in three directions, for the
      purpose of landing at three points at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must be done?&rdquo; said an officer of the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop them; and if they persist, fire!&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, the cannonade commenced. These were the shots that
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had heard as he landed in France. But the boats were too near
      the mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly. They landed, and the combat
      commenced hand to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Porthos?&rdquo; said Aramis to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! nothing!&mdash;only my legs; it is really incomprehensible!&mdash;they
      will be better when we charge.&rdquo; In fact, Porthos and Aramis did charge
      with such vigor, and so thoroughly animated their men, that the royalists
      re-embarked precipitately, without gaining anything but the wounds they
      carried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! but Porthos,&rdquo; cried Aramis, &ldquo;we must have a prisoner, quick! quick!&rdquo;
       Porthos bent over the stair of the mole, and seized by the nape of the
      neck one of the officers of the royal army who was waiting to embark till
      all his people should be in the boat. The arm of the giant lifted up his
      prey, which served him as a buckler, and he recovered himself without a
      shot being fired at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a prisoner for you,&rdquo; said Porthos coolly to Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried the latter, laughing, &ldquo;did you not calumniate your legs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not with my legs I captured him,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;it was with my
      arms!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVI. The Son of Biscarrat.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Bretons of the Isle were very proud of this victory; Aramis did not
      encourage them in the feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will happen,&rdquo; said he to Porthos, when everybody was gone home,
      &ldquo;will be that the anger of the king will be roused by the account of the
      resistance; and that these brave people will be decimated or shot when
      they are taken, which cannot fail to take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From which it results, then,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;that what we have done is of
      not the slightest use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the moment it may be,&rdquo; replied the bishop, &ldquo;for we have a prisoner
      from whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let us interrogate the prisoner,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;and the means of
      making him speak are very simple. We are going to supper; we will invite
      him to join us; as he drinks he will talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was done. The officer was at first rather uneasy, but became
      reassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal with. He gave, without
      having any fear of compromising himself, all the details imaginable of the
      resignation and departure of D&rsquo;Artagnan. He explained how, after that
      departure, the new leader of the expedition had ordered a surprise upon
      Belle-Isle. There his explanations stopped. Aramis and Porthos exchanged a
      glance that evinced their despair. No more dependence to be placed now on
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s fertile imagination&mdash;no further resource in the event of
      defeat. Aramis, continuing his interrogations, asked the prisoner what the
      leaders of the expedition contemplated doing with the leaders of
      Belle-Isle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The orders are,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;to kill <i>during</i> combat, or hang <i>afterwards</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos and Aramis looked at each other again, and the color mounted to
      their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too light for the gallows,&rdquo; replied Aramis; &ldquo;people like me are not
      hung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am too heavy,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;people like me break the cord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said the prisoner, gallantly, &ldquo;that we could have guaranteed
      you the exact kind of death you preferred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks!&rdquo; said Aramis, seriously. Porthos bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more cup of wine to your health,&rdquo; said he, drinking himself. From one
      subject to another the chat with the officer was prolonged. He was an
      intelligent gentleman, and suffered himself to be led on by the charm of
      Aramis&rsquo;s wit and Porthos&rsquo;s cordial <i>bonhomie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I address a question to you; but men who are in
      their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Address it!&rdquo; cried Porthos; &ldquo;address it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, and amongst the best of them, if you please,&rdquo; said
      Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true; I should say even the best of all soldiers, messieurs, if I
      did not fear to offend the memory of my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your father?&rdquo; cried Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what my name is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> no, monsieur; but you can tell us, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am called Georges de Biscarrat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Porthos, in his turn. &ldquo;Biscarrat! Do you remember that name,
      Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biscarrat!&rdquo; reflected the bishop. &ldquo;It seems to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to recollect, monsieur,&rdquo; said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> that won&rsquo;t take me long,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;Biscarrat&mdash;called
      Cardinal&mdash;one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we
      formed our friendship with D&rsquo;Artagnan, sword in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only one,&rdquo; cried Aramis, eagerly, &ldquo;we could not scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently, a capital blade?&rdquo; said the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true! most true!&rdquo; exclaimed both friends together. &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>
      Monsieur Biscarrat, we are delighted to make the acquaintance of such a
      brave man&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biscarrat pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers. Aramis looked
      at Porthos as much as to say, &ldquo;Here is a man who will help us,&rdquo; and
      without delay,&mdash;&ldquo;Confess, monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that it is good to
      have once been a good man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father always said so, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess, likewise, that it is a sad circumstance in which you find
      yourself, of falling in with men destined to be shot or hung, and to learn
      that these men are old acquaintances, in fact, hereditary friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that, messieurs and
      friends!&rdquo; said the young man, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! you said so yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said so just now, when I did not know you; but now that I know you, I
      say&mdash;you will evade this dismal fate, if you wish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;if we wish?&rdquo; echoed Aramis, whose eyes beamed with intelligence
      as he looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided,&rdquo; continued Porthos, looking, in his turn, with noble
      intrepidity, at M. Biscarrat and the bishop&mdash;&ldquo;provided nothing
      disgraceful be required of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all will be required of you, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied the officer&mdash;&ldquo;what
      should they ask of you? If they find you they will kill you, that is a
      predetermined thing; try, then, gentlemen, to prevent their finding you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am mistaken,&rdquo; said Porthos, with dignity; &ldquo;but it appears
      evident to me that if they want to find us, they must come and seek us
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that you are perfectly right, my worthy friend,&rdquo; replied Aramis,
      constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat, who had
      grown silent and constrained. &ldquo;You wish, Monsieur de Biscarrat, to say
      something to us, to make us some overture, and you dare not&mdash;is that
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! gentlemen and friends! it is because by speaking I betray the
      watchword. But, hark! I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannon!&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannon and musketry, too!&rdquo; cried the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing at a distance, among the rocks, these sinister reports of a
      combat which they thought had ceased:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can that be?&rdquo; asked Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! <i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo; cried Aramis; &ldquo;that is just what I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the attack made by you was nothing but a feint; is not that true,
      monsieur? And whilst your companions allowed themselves to be repulsed,
      you were certain of effecting a landing on the other side of the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! several, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are lost, then,&rdquo; said the bishop of Vannes, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost! that is possible,&rdquo; replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, &ldquo;but we are
      not taken or hung.&rdquo; And so saying, he rose from the table, went to the
      wall, and coolly took down his sword and pistols, which he examined with
      the care of an old soldier who is preparing for battle, and who feels that
      life, in a great measure, depends upon the excellence and right conditions
      of his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the report of the cannon, at the news of the surprise which might
      deliver up the island to the royal troops, the terrified crowd rushed
      precipitately to the fort to demand assistance and advice from their
      leaders. Aramis, pale and downcast, between two flambeaux, showed himself
      at the window which looked into the principal court, full of soldiers
      waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring succor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Herblay, in a grave and sonorous voice, &ldquo;M. Fouquet,
      your protector, your friend, you father, has been arrested by an order of
      the king, and thrown into the Bastile.&rdquo; A sustained yell of vengeful fury
      came floating up to the window at which the bishop stood, and enveloped
      him in a magnetic field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avenge Monsieur Fouquet!&rdquo; cried the most excited of his hearers, &ldquo;death
      to the royalists!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friends,&rdquo; replied Aramis, solemnly; &ldquo;no, my friends; no
      resistance. The king is master in his kingdom. The king is the mandatory
      of God. The king and God have struck M. Fouquet. Humble yourselves before
      the hand of God. Love God and the king, who have struck M. Fouquet. But do
      not avenge your seigneur, do not think of avenging him. You would
      sacrifice yourselves in vain&mdash;you, your wives and children, your
      property, your liberty. Lay down your arms, my friends&mdash;lay down your
      arms! since the king commands you so to do&mdash;and retire peaceably to
      your dwellings. It is I who ask you to do so; it is I who beg you to do
      so; it is I who now, in the hour of need, command you to do so, in the
      name of M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger and
      terror. &ldquo;The soldiers of Louis XIV. have reached the island,&rdquo; continued
      Aramis. &ldquo;From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt them and you&mdash;it
      would be a massacre. Begone, then, begone, and forget; this time I command
      you, in the name of the Lord of Hosts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mutineers retired slowly, submissive, silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what have you just been saying, my friend?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Biscarrat to the bishop, &ldquo;you may save all these
      inhabitants, but thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Biscarrat,&rdquo; said the bishop of Vannes, with a singular accent
      of nobility and courtesy, &ldquo;Monsieur de Biscarrat, be kind enough to resume
      your liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very willing to do so, monsieur; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would render us a service, for when announcing to the king&rsquo;s
      lieutenant the submission of the islanders, you will perhaps obtain some
      grace for us on informing him of the manner in which that submission has
      been effected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace!&rdquo; replied Porthos with flashing eyes, &ldquo;what is the meaning of that
      word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis touched the elbow of his friend roughly, as he had been accustomed
      to do in the days of their youth, when he wanted to warn Porthos that he
      had committed, or was about to commit, a blunder. Porthos understood him,
      and was silent immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go, messieurs,&rdquo; replied Biscarrat, a little surprised likewise at
      the word &ldquo;grace&rdquo; pronounced by the haughty musketeer, of and to whom, but
      a few minutes before, he had related with so much enthusiasm the heroic
      exploits with which his father had delighted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, then, Monsieur Biscarrat,&rdquo; said Aramis, bowing to him, &ldquo;and at
      parting receive the expression of our entire gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends,
      since you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of you
      in the meantime?&rdquo; replied the officer, very much agitated at taking leave
      of the two ancient adversaries of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will wait here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, <i>mon Dieu!</i>&mdash;the order is precise and formal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bishop of Vannes, Monsieur de Biscarrat; and they no more shoot a
      bishop than they hang a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, monsieur&mdash;yes, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Biscarrat; &ldquo;it is
      true, you are right, there is still that chance for you. Then, I will
      depart, I will repair to the commander of the expedition, the king&rsquo;s
      lieutenant. Adieu! then, messieurs, or rather, to meet again, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy officer, jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis, departed in
      the direction of the sound of cannon, which, by surging the crowd into the
      fort, had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with their
      prisoner. Aramis watched the departure, and when left alone with Porthos:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you comprehend?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not Biscarrat inconvenience you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is a brave fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but the grotto of Locmaria&mdash;is it necessary all the world
      should know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is true, that is true; I comprehend. We are going to escape by
      the cavern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; cried Aramis, gayly. &ldquo;Forward, friend Porthos; our boat
      awaits us. King Louis has not caught us&mdash;<i>yet</i>.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVII. The Grotto of Locmaria.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render it
      necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to reach it.
      Besides, night was advancing; midnight had struck at the fort. Porthos and
      Aramis were loaded with money and arms. They walked, then, across the
      heath, which stretched between the mole and the cavern, listening to every
      noise, in order better to avoid an ambush. From time to time, on the road
      which they had carefully left on their left, passed fugitives coming from
      the interior, at the news of the landing of the royal troops. Aramis and
      Porthos, concealed behind some projecting mass of rock, collected the
      words that escaped from the poor people, who fled, trembling, carrying
      with them their most valuable effects, and tried, whilst listening to
      their complaints, to gather something from them for their own interest. At
      length, after a rapid race, frequently interrupted by prudent stoppages,
      they reached the deep grottoes, in which the prophetic bishop of Vannes
      had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of keeping the sea at this
      fine season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Porthos, panting vigorously, &ldquo;we have arrived, it
      seems. But I thought you spoke of three men, three servants, who were to
      accompany us. I don&rsquo;t see them&mdash;where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you see them, Porthos?&rdquo; replied Aramis. &ldquo;They are certainly
      waiting for us in the cavern, and, no doubt, are resting, having
      accomplished their rough and difficult task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis stopped Porthos, who was preparing to enter the cavern. &ldquo;Will you
      allow me, my friend,&rdquo; said he to the giant, &ldquo;to pass in first? I know the
      signal I have given to these men; who, not hearing it, would be very
      likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then, Aramis; go on&mdash;go first; you impersonate wisdom and
      foresight; go. Ah! there is that fatigue again, of which I spoke to you.
      It has just seized me afresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto, and bowing his
      head, he penetrated into the interior of the cavern, imitating the cry of
      the owl. A little plaintive cooing, a scarcely distinct echo, replied from
      the depths of the cave. Aramis pursued his way cautiously, and soon was
      stopped by the same kind of cry as he had first uttered, within ten paces
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you there, Yves?&rdquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur; Goenne is here likewise. His son accompanies us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. Are all things ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the entrance of the grottoes, my good Yves, and you will there find
      the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, who is resting after the fatigue of our
      journey. And if he should happen not to be able to walk, lift him up, and
      bring him hither to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three men obeyed. But the recommendation given to his servants was
      superfluous. Porthos, refreshed, had already commenced the descent, and
      his heavy step resounded amongst the cavities, formed and supported by
      columns of porphyry and granite. As soon as the Seigneur de Bracieux had
      rejoined the bishop, the Bretons lighted a lantern with which they were
      furnished, and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as strong again as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us inspect the boat,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;and satisfy ourselves at once
      what it will hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not go too near with the light,&rdquo; said the patron Yves; &ldquo;for as you
      desired me, monseigneur, I have placed under the bench of the poop, in the
      coffer you know of, the barrel of powder, and the musket-charges that you
      sent me from the fort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Aramis; and, taking the lantern himself, he examined
      minutely all parts of the canoe, with the precautions of a man who is
      neither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger. The canoe was long,
      light, drawing little water, thin of keel; in short, one of those that
      have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle; a little high in its sides,
      solid upon the water, very manageable, furnished with planks which, in
      uncertain weather, formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide,
      so as to protect the rowers. In two well-closed coffers, placed beneath
      the benches of the prow and the poop, Aramis found bread, biscuit, dried
      fruits, a quarter of bacon, a good provision of water in leathern bottles;
      the whole forming rations sufficient for people who did not mean to quit
      the coast, and would be able to revictual, if necessity commanded. The
      arms, eight muskets, and as many horse-pistols, were in good condition,
      and all loaded. There were additional oars, in case of accident, and that
      little sail called <i>trinquet</i>, which assists the speed of the canoe
      at the same time the boatmen row, and is so useful when the breeze is
      slack. When Aramis had seen to all these things, and appeared satisfied
      with the result of his inspection, &ldquo;Let us consult Porthos,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
      know if we must endeavor to get the boat out by the unknown extremity of
      the grotto, following the descent and the shade of the cavern, or whether
      it be better, in the open air, to make it slide upon its rollers through
      the bushes, leveling the road of the little beach, which is but twenty
      feet high, and gives, at high tide, three or four fathoms of good water
      upon a sound bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be as you please, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the skipper Yves,
      respectfully; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe that by the slope of the cavern, and in
      the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat, the road will
      be so convenient as the open air. I know the beach well, and can certify
      that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden; the interior of the
      grotto, on the contrary, is rough; without reckoning, monseigneur, that at
      its extremity we shall come to the trench which leads into the sea, and
      perhaps the canoe will not pass down it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made my calculation,&rdquo; said the bishop, &ldquo;and I am certain it will
      pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it; I wish it may, monseigneur,&rdquo; continued Yves; &ldquo;but your highness
      knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the trench, there
      is an enormous stone to be lifted&mdash;that under which the fox always
      passes, and which closes the trench like a door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be raised,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;that is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men,&rdquo; replied Yves;
      &ldquo;but that is giving him a great deal of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the skipper may be right,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;let us try the open-air
      passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more so, monseigneur,&rdquo; continued the fisherman, &ldquo;that we should not
      be able to embark before day, it will require so much labor, and that as
      soon as daylight appears, a good <i>vedette</i> placed outside the grotto
      would be necessary, indispensable even, to watch the maneuvers of the
      lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Yves, your reasons are good; we will go by the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the three robust Bretons went to the boat, and were beginning to place
      their rollers underneath it to put it in motion, when the distant barking
      of dogs was heard, proceeding from the interior of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis darted out of the grotto, followed by Porthos. Dawn just tinted
      with purple and white the waves and plain; through the dim light,
      melancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles, and
      long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the shimmering
      fields of buckwheat. In a quarter of an hour it would be clear daylight;
      the wakened birds announced it to all nature. The barkings which had been
      heard, which had stopped the three fishermen engaged in moving the boat,
      and had brought Aramis and Porthos out of the cavern, now seemed to come
      from a deep gorge within about a league of the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pack of hounds,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;the dogs are on a scent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can be hunting at such a moment as this?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this way, particularly,&rdquo; continued Porthos, &ldquo;where they might expect
      the army of the royalists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The noise comes nearer. Yes, you are right, Porthos, the dogs are on a
      scent. But, Yves!&rdquo; cried Aramis, &ldquo;come here! come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yves ran towards him, letting fall the cylinder which he was about to
      place under the boat when the bishop&rsquo;s call interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! monseigneur, I cannot understand it,&rdquo; replied the Breton. &ldquo;It is not
      at such a moment that the Seigneur de Locmaria would hunt. No, and yet the
      dogs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless they have escaped from the kennel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Goenne, &ldquo;they are not the Seigneur de Locmaria&rsquo;s hounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In common prudence,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;let us go back into the grotto; the
      voices evidently draw nearer, we shall soon know what we have to trust
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They re-entered, but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the
      darkness, when a noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress
      resounded through the cavern, and breathless, rapid, terrified, a fox
      passed like a flash of lightning before the fugitives, leaped over the
      boat and disappeared, leaving behind its sour scent, which was perceptible
      for several seconds under the low vaults of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fox!&rdquo; cried the Bretons, with the glad surprise of born hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accursed mischance!&rdquo; cried the bishop, &ldquo;our retreat is discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;are you afraid of a fox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! my friend, what do you mean by that? why do you specify the fox? It
      is not the fox alone. <i>Pardieu!</i> But don&rsquo;t you know, Porthos, that
      after the foxes come hounds, and after hounds men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos hung his head. As though to confirm the words of Aramis, they
      heard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness upon the trail.
      Six foxhounds burst at once upon the little heath, with mingling yelps of
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the dogs, plain enough!&rdquo; said Aramis, posted on the look-out
      behind a chink in the rocks; &ldquo;now, who are the huntsmen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is the Seigneur de Locmaria&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;he will leave
      the dogs to hunt the grotto, for he knows them, and will not enter in
      himself, being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side; it is
      there he will wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the Seigneur de Locmaria who is hunting,&rdquo; replied Aramis,
      turning pale in spite of his efforts to maintain a placid countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it, then?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos applied his eye to the slit, and saw at the summit of a hillock a
      dozen horsemen urging on their horses in the track of the dogs, shouting,
      &ldquo;<i>Taiaut! taiaut!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guards!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend, the king&rsquo;s guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s guards! do you say, monseigneur?&rdquo; cried the Bretons, growing
      pale in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Biscarrat at their head, mounted upon my gray horse,&rdquo; continued
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche,
      and the depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the devil!&rdquo; said Aramis, resuming all his coolness at the sight of
      this certain, inevitable danger. &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied we are lost,
      but we have, at least, one chance left. If the guards who follow their
      hounds happen to discover there is an issue to the grotto, there is no
      help for us, for on entering they must see both ourselves and our boat.
      The dogs must not go out of the cavern. Their masters must not enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is clear,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; added Aramis, with the rapid precision of command;
      &ldquo;there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under
      which the fox has glided&mdash;but at the too narrow opening of which they
      must be themselves stopped and killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bretons sprang forward, knife in hand. In a few minutes there was a
      lamentable concert of angry barks and mortal howls&mdash;and then,
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; said Aramis, coolly, &ldquo;now for the masters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done with them?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait their arrival, conceal ourselves, and kill them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Kill them!</i>&rdquo; replied Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are sixteen,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;at least, at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And well armed,&rdquo; added Porthos, with a smile of consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will last about ten minutes,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;To work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a resolute air he took up a musket, and placed a hunting-knife
      between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yves, Goenne, and his son,&rdquo; continued Aramis, &ldquo;will pass the muskets to
      us. You, Porthos, will fire when they are close. We shall have brought
      down, at the lowest computation, eight, before the others are aware of
      anything&mdash;that is certain; then all, there are five of us, will
      dispatch the other eight, knife in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And poor Biscarrat?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis reflected a moment&mdash;&ldquo;Biscarrat first,&rdquo; replied he, coolly. &ldquo;He
      knows us.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVIII. The Grotto.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of the
      character of Aramis, the event, subject to the risks of things over which
      uncertainty presides, did not fall out exactly as the bishop of Vannes had
      foreseen. Biscarrat, better mounted than his companions, arrived first at
      the opening of the grotto, and comprehended that fox and hounds were one
      and all engulfed in it. Only, struck by that superstitious terror which
      every dark and subterraneous way naturally impresses upon the mind of man,
      he stopped at the outside of the grotto, and waited till his companions
      should have assembled round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; asked the young men, coming up, out of breath, and unable to
      understand the meaning of this inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I cannot hear the dogs; they and the fox must all be lost in this
      infernal cavern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were too close up,&rdquo; said one of the guards, &ldquo;to have lost scent all
      at once. Besides, we should hear them from one side or another. They must,
      as Biscarrat says, be in this grotto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said one of the young men, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t they give tongue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange!&rdquo; muttered another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said a fourth, &ldquo;let us go into this grotto. Does it happen to
      be forbidden we should enter it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Biscarrat. &ldquo;Only, as it looks as dark as a wolf&rsquo;s mouth, we
      might break our necks in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Witness the dogs,&rdquo; said a guard, &ldquo;who seem to have broken theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil can have become of them?&rdquo; asked the young men in chorus.
      And every master called his dog by his name, whistled to him in his
      favorite mode, without a single one replying to either call or whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps an enchanted grotto,&rdquo; said Biscarrat; &ldquo;let us see.&rdquo; And,
      jumping from his horse, he made a step into the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop! I will accompany you,&rdquo; said one of the guards, on seeing
      Biscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Biscarrat, &ldquo;there must be something extraordinary in the
      place&mdash;don&rsquo;t let us risk ourselves all at once. If in ten minutes you
      do not hear of me, you can come in, but not all at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the young man, who, besides, did not imagine that
      Biscarrat ran much risk in the enterprise, &ldquo;we will wait for you.&rdquo; And
      without dismounting from their horses, they formed a circle round the
      grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biscarrat entered then alone, and advanced through the darkness till he
      came in contact with the muzzle of Porthos&rsquo;s musket. The resistance which
      his chest met with astonished him; he naturally raised his hand and laid
      hold of the icy barrel. At the same instant, Yves lifted a knife against
      the young man, which was about to fall upon him with all force of a
      Breton&rsquo;s arm, when the iron wrist of Porthos stopped it half-way. Then,
      like low muttering thunder, his voice growled in the darkness, &ldquo;I will not
      have him killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biscarrat found himself between a protection and a threat, the one almost
      as terrible as the other. However brave the young man might be, he could
      not prevent a cry escaping him, which Aramis immediately suppressed by
      placing a handkerchief over his mouth. &ldquo;Monsieur de Biscarrat,&rdquo; said he,
      in a low voice, &ldquo;we mean you no harm, and you must know that if you have
      recognized us; but, at the first word, the first groan, the first whisper,
      we shall be forced to kill you as we have killed your dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I recognize you, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the officer, in a low voice. &ldquo;But
      why are you here&mdash;what are you doing, here? Unfortunate men! I
      thought you were in the fort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did all I was able, messieurs, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are positive orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To kill us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biscarrat made no reply. It would have cost him too much to speak of the
      cord to gentlemen. Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Biscarrat,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you would be already dead if we had not
      regard for your youth and our ancient association with your father; but
      you may yet escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell your
      companions what you have seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not only swear that I will not speak of it,&rdquo; said Biscarrat, &ldquo;but
      I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to prevent my
      companions from setting foot in the grotto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biscarrat! Biscarrat!&rdquo; cried several voices from the outside, coming like
      a whirlwind into the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reply,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; cried Biscarrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, begone; we depend on your loyalty.&rdquo; And he left his hold of the
      young man, who hastily returned towards the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biscarrat! Biscarrat!&rdquo; cried the voices, still nearer. And the shadows of
      several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto. Biscarrat
      rushed to meet his friends in order to stop them, and met them just as
      they were adventuring into the cave. Aramis and Porthos listened with the
      intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the guards, as he came to the light, &ldquo;how pale
      you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pale!&rdquo; cried another; &ldquo;you ought to say corpse-color.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said the young man, endeavoring to collect his faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Heaven! what has happened?&rdquo; exclaimed all the voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not a drop of blood in your veins, my poor friend,&rdquo; said one of
      them, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, it is serious,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;he is going to faint; does any
      one of you happen to have any salts?&rdquo; And they all laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hail of jests fell round Biscarrat&rsquo;s ears like musket-balls in a <i>melee</i>.
      He recovered himself amidst a deluge of interrogations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose I have seen?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;I was too hot when I entered
      the grotto, and I have been struck with a chill. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the dogs, the dogs; have you seen them again&mdash;did you see
      anything of them&mdash;do you know anything about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they have got out some other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said one of the young men, &ldquo;there is in that which is going
      on, in the paleness and silence of our friend, a mystery which Biscarrat
      will not, or cannot reveal. Only, and this is certain, Biscarrat has seen
      something in the grotto. Well, for my part, I am very curious to see what
      it is, even if it is the devil! To the grotto! messieurs, to the grotto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the grotto!&rdquo; repeated all the voices. And the echo of the cavern
      carried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis, &ldquo;To the grotto! to the
      grotto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biscarrat threw himself before his companions. &ldquo;Messieurs! messieurs!&rdquo;
       cried he, &ldquo;in the name of Heaven! do not go in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?&rdquo; asked several at once.
      &ldquo;Come, speak, Biscarrat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly, it is the devil he has seen,&rdquo; repeated he who had before
      advanced that hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;if he has seen him, he need not be selfish; he may
      as well let us have a look at him in turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs! messieurs! I beseech you,&rdquo; urged Biscarrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Let us pass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, I implore you not to enter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you went in yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then one of the officers, who&mdash;of a riper age than the others&mdash;had
      till this time remained behind, and had said nothing, advanced.
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said he, with a calmness which contrasted with the animation
      of the young men, &ldquo;there is in there some person, or something, that is
      not the devil; but which, whatever it may be, has had sufficient power to
      silence our dogs. We must discover who this some one is, or what this
      something is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biscarrat made a last effort to stop his friends, but it was useless. In
      vain he threw himself before the rashest; in vain he clung to the rocks to
      bar the passage; the crowd of young men rushed into the cave, in the steps
      of the officer who had spoken last, but who had sprung in first, sword in
      hand, to face the unknown danger. Biscarrat, repulsed by his friends,
      unable to accompany them, without passing in the eyes of Porthos and
      Aramis for a traitor and a perjurer, with painfully attentive ear and
      unconsciously supplicating hands leaned against the rough side of a rock
      which he thought must be exposed to the fire of the musketeers. As to the
      guards, they penetrated further and further, with exclamations that grew
      fainter as they advanced. All at once, a discharge of musketry, growling
      like thunder, exploded in the entrails of the vault. Two or three balls
      were flattened against the rock on which Biscarrat was leaning. At the
      same instant, cries, shrieks, imprecations burst forth, and the little
      troop of gentlemen reappeared&mdash;some pale, some bleeding&mdash;all
      enveloped in a cloud of smoke, which the outer air seemed to suck from the
      depths of the cavern. &ldquo;Biscarrat! Biscarrat!&rdquo; cried the fugitives, &ldquo;you
      knew there was an ambuscade in that cavern, and you did not warn us!
      Biscarrat, you are the cause that four of us are murdered men! Woe be to
      you, Biscarrat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the cause of my being wounded unto death,&rdquo; said one of the young
      men, letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm, and
      spattering it into Biscarrat&rsquo;s livid face. &ldquo;My blood be on your head!&rdquo; And
      he rolled in agony at the feet of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, at least, tell us who is there?&rdquo; cried several furious voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biscarrat remained silent. &ldquo;Tell us, or die!&rdquo; cried the wounded man,
      raising himself upon one knee, and lifting towards his companion an arm
      bearing a useless sword. Biscarrat rushed towards him, opening his breast
      for the blow, but the wounded man fell back not to rise again, uttering a
      groan which was his last. Biscarrat, with hair on end, haggard eyes, and
      bewildered head, advanced towards the interior of the cavern, saying, &ldquo;You
      are right. Death to me, who have allowed my comrades to be assassinated. I
      am a worthless wretch!&rdquo; And throwing away his sword, for he wished to die
      without defending himself, he rushed head foremost into the cavern. The
      others followed him. The eleven who remained out of sixteen imitated his
      example; but they did not go further than the first. A second discharge
      laid five upon the icy sand; and as it was impossible to see whence this
      murderous thunder issued, the others fell back with a terror that can be
      better imagined than described. But, far from flying, as the others had
      done, Biscarrat remained safe and sound, seated on a fragment of rock, and
      waited. There were only six gentlemen left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; said one of the survivors, &ldquo;is it the devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> it is much worse,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Biscarrat, he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Biscarrat?&rdquo; The young men looked round them, and saw that
      Biscarrat did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo; said two or three voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no!&rdquo; replied another, &ldquo;I saw him through the smoke, sitting quietly
      on a rock. He is in the cavern; he is waiting for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must know who are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how should he know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was taken prisoner by the rebels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. Well! let us call him, and learn from him whom we have to
      deal with.&rdquo; And all voices shouted, &ldquo;Biscarrat! Biscarrat!&rdquo; But Biscarrat
      did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the officer who had shown so much coolness in the affair. &ldquo;We
      have no longer any need of him; here are reinforcements coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, a company of guards, left in the rear by their officers, whom the
      ardor of the chase had carried away&mdash;from seventy-five to eighty men&mdash;arrived
      in good order, led by their captain and the first lieutenant. The five
      officers hastened to meet their soldiers; and, in language the eloquence
      of which may be easily imagined, they related the adventure, and asked for
      aid. The captain interrupted them. &ldquo;Where are your companions?&rdquo; demanded
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there were sixteen of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten are dead. Biscarrat is in the cavern, and we are five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biscarrat is a prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for here he is&mdash;look.&rdquo; In fact, Biscarrat appeared at the
      opening of the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is making a sign to come on,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried all the troop. And they advanced to meet Biscarrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the captain, addressing Biscarrat, &ldquo;I am assured that you
      know who the men are in that grotto, and who make such a desperate
      defense. In the king&rsquo;s name I command you to declare what you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Biscarrat, &ldquo;you have no need to command me. My word has
      been restored to me this very instant; and I came in the name of these
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell me who they are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you they are determined to defend themselves to the death, unless
      you grant them satisfactory terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many are there of them, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two,&rdquo; said Biscarrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two&mdash;and want to impose conditions upon us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two, and they have already killed ten of our men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of people are they&mdash;giants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that. Do you remember the history of the Bastion
      Saint-Gervais, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; where four musketeers held out against an army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, these are two of those same musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And their names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that period they were called Porthos and Aramis. Now they are styled
      M. d&rsquo;Herblay and M. du Vallon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what interest have they in all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is they who were holding Bell-Isle for M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur ran through the ranks of the soldiers on hearing the two words
      &ldquo;Porthos and Aramis.&rdquo; &ldquo;The musketeers! the musketeers!&rdquo; repeated they. And
      among all these brave men, the idea that they were going to have a
      struggle against two of the oldest glories of the French army, made a
      shiver, half enthusiasm, two-thirds terror, run through them. In fact,
      those four names&mdash;D&rsquo;Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis&mdash;were
      venerated among all who wore a sword; as, in antiquity, the names of
      Hercules, Theseus, Castor, and Pollux were venerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two men&mdash;and they have killed ten in two discharges! It is
      impossible, Monsieur Biscarrat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! captain,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;I do not tell you that they have not
      with them two or three men, as the musketeers of the Bastion Saint-Gervais
      had two or three lackeys; but, believe me, captain, I have seen these men,
      I have been taken prisoner by them&mdash;I know they themselves alone are
      all-sufficient to destroy an army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we shall see,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;and that in a moment, too.
      Gentlemen, attention!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this reply, no one stirred, and all prepared to obey. Biscarrat alone
      risked a last attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, &ldquo;be persuaded by me; let us pass on
      our way. Those two men, those two lions you are going to attack, will
      defend themselves to the death. They have already killed ten of our men;
      they will kill double the number, and end by killing themselves rather
      than surrender. What shall we gain by fighting them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall gain the consciousness, monsieur, of not having allowed eighty
      of the king&rsquo;s guards to retire before two rebels. If I listened to your
      advice, monsieur, I should be a dishonored man; and by dishonoring myself
      I should dishonor the army. Forward, my men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he marched first as far as the opening of the grotto. There he halted.
      The object of this halt was to give Biscarrat and his companions time to
      describe to him the interior of the grotto. Then, when he believed he had
      a sufficient acquaintance with the place, he divided his company into
      three bodies, which were to enter successively, keeping up a sustained
      fire in all directions. No doubt, in this attack they would lose five
      more, perhaps ten; but, certainly, they must end by taking the rebels,
      since there was no issue; and, at any rate, two men could not kill eighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Biscarrat, &ldquo;I beg to be allowed to march at the head of
      the first platoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; replied the captain; &ldquo;you have all the honor. I make you a
      present of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; replied the young man, with all the firmness of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your sword, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go as I am, captain,&rdquo; said Biscarrat, &ldquo;for I do not go to kill, I
      go to be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And placing himself at the head of the first platoon, with head uncovered
      and arms crossed,&mdash;&ldquo;March, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIX. An Homeric Song.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is time to pass to the other camp, and to describe at once the
      combatants and the field of battle. Aramis and Porthos had gone to the
      grotto of Locmaria with the expectation of finding there their canoe ready
      armed, as well as the three Bretons, their assistants; and they at first
      hoped to make the bark pass through the little issue of the cavern,
      concealing in that fashion both their labors and their flight. The arrival
      of the fox and dogs obliged them to remain concealed. The grotto extended
      the space of about a hundred <i>toises</i>, to that little slope
      dominating a creek. Formerly a temple of the Celtic divinities, when
      Belle-Isle was still called Kalonese, this grotto had beheld more than one
      human sacrifice accomplished in its mystic depths. The first entrance to
      the cavern was by a moderate descent, above which distorted rocks formed a
      weird arcade; the interior, very uneven and dangerous from the
      inequalities of the vault, was subdivided into several compartments, which
      communicated with each other by means of rough and jagged steps, fixed
      right and left, in uncouth natural pillars. At the third compartment the
      vault was so low, the passage so narrow, that the bark would scarcely have
      passed without touching the side; nevertheless, in moments of despair,
      wood softens and stone grows flexible beneath the human will. Such was the
      thought of Aramis, when, after having fought the fight, he decided upon
      flight&mdash;a flight most dangerous, since all the assailants were not
      dead; and that, admitting the possibility of putting the bark to sea, they
      would have to fly in open day, before the conquered, so interested on
      recognizing their small number, in pursuing their conquerors. When the two
      discharges had killed ten men, Aramis, familiar with the windings of the
      cavern, went to reconnoiter them one by one, and counted them, for the
      smoke prevented seeing outside; and he immediately commanded that the
      canoe should be rolled as far as the great stone, the closure of the
      liberating issue. Porthos collected all his strength, took the canoe in
      his arms, and raised it up, whilst the Bretons made it run rapidly along
      the rollers. They had descended into the third compartment; they had
      arrived at the stone which walled the outlet. Porthos seized this gigantic
      stone at its base, applied his robust shoulder, and gave a heave which
      made the wall crack. A cloud of dust fell from the vault, with the ashes
      of ten thousand generations of sea birds, whose nests stuck like cement to
      the rock. At the third shock the stone gave way, and oscillated for a
      minute. Porthos, placing his back against the neighboring rock, made an
      arch with his foot, which drove the block out of the calcareous masses
      which served for hinges and cramps. The stone fell, and daylight was
      visible, brilliant, radiant, flooding the cavern through the opening, and
      the blue sea appeared to the delighted Bretons. They began to lift the
      bark over the barricade. Twenty more <i>toises</i>, and it would glide
      into the ocean. It was during this time that the company arrived, was
      drawn up by the captain, and disposed for either an escalade or an
      assault. Aramis watched over everything, to favor the labors of his
      friends. He saw the reinforcements, counted the men, and convinced himself
      at a single glance of the insurmountable peril to which fresh combat would
      expose them. To escape by sea, at the moment the cavern was about to be
      invaded, was impossible. In fact, the daylight which had just been
      admitted to the last compartments had exposed to the soldiers the bark
      being rolled towards the sea, the two rebels within musket-shot; and one
      of their discharges would riddle the boat if it did not kill the
      navigators. Besides, allowing everything,&mdash;if the bark escaped with
      the men on board of it, how could the alarm be suppressed&mdash;how could
      notice to the royal lighters be prevented? What could hinder the poor
      canoe, followed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before
      the end of the day? Aramis, digging his hands into his gray hair with
      rage, invoked the assistance of God and the assistance of the demons.
      Calling to Porthos, who was doing more work than all the rollers&mdash;whether
      of flesh or wood&mdash;&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our adversaries have just
      received a reinforcement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; said Porthos, quietly, &ldquo;what is to be done, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To recommence the combat,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;is hazardous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;for it is difficult to suppose that out of two, one
      should not be killed; and certainly, if one of us was killed, the other
      would get himself killed also.&rdquo; Porthos spoke these words with that heroic
      nature which, with him, grew grander with necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis felt it like a spur to his heart. &ldquo;We shall neither of us be killed
      if you do what I tell you, friend Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These people are coming down into the grotto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could kill about fifteen of them, but no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many are there in all?&rdquo; asked Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have received a reinforcement of seventy-five men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-five and five, eighty. Ah!&rdquo; sighed Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they fire all at once they will riddle us with balls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly they will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without reckoning,&rdquo; added Aramis, &ldquo;that the detonation might occasion a
      collapse of the cavern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;a piece of falling rock just now grazed my shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must determine upon something quickly. Our Bretons are going to
      continue to roll the canoe towards the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We two will keep the powder, the balls, and the muskets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But only two, my dear Aramis&mdash;we shall never fire three shots
      together,&rdquo; said Porthos, innocently, &ldquo;the defense by musketry is a bad
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find a better, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found one,&rdquo; said the giant, eagerly; &ldquo;I will place myself in
      ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar, and invisible,
      unattackable, if they come in floods, I can let my bar fall upon their
      skulls, thirty times in a minute. <i>Hein!</i> what do you think of the
      project? You smile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, dear friend, perfect! I approve it greatly; only you will
      frighten them, and half of them will remain outside to take us by famine.
      What we want, my good friend, is the entire destruction of the troop. A
      single survivor encompasses our ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my friend, but how can we attract them, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By not stirring, my good Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! we won&rsquo;t stir, then; but when they are all together&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then leave it to me, I have an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is so, and your idea proves a good one&mdash;and your idea is most
      likely to be good&mdash;I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your ambuscade, Porthos, and count how many enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about me; I have a task to perform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I hear shouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is they! To your post. Keep within reach of my voice and hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos took refuge in the second compartment, which was in darkness,
      absolutely black. Aramis glided into the third; the giant held in his hand
      an iron bar of about fifty pounds weight. Porthos handled this lever,
      which had been used in rolling the bark, with marvelous facility. During
      this time, the Bretons had pushed the bark to the beach. In the further
      and lighter compartment, Aramis, stooping and concealed, was busy with
      some mysterious maneuver. A command was given in a loud voice. It was the
      last order of the captain commandant. Twenty-five men jumped from the
      upper rocks into the first compartment of the grotto, and having taken
      their ground, began to fire. The echoes shrieked and barked, the hissing
      balls seemed actually to rarefy the air, and then opaque smoke filled the
      vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the left! to the left!&rdquo; cried Biscarrat, who, in his first assault,
      had seen the passage to the second chamber, and who, animated by the smell
      of powder, wished to guide his soldiers in that direction. The troop,
      accordingly, precipitated themselves to the left&mdash;the passage
      gradually growing narrower. Biscarrat, with his hands stretched forward,
      devoted to death, marched in advance of the muskets. &ldquo;Come on! come on!&rdquo;
       exclaimed he, &ldquo;I see daylight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike, Porthos!&rdquo; cried the sepulchral voice of Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos breathed a heavy sigh&mdash;but he obeyed. The iron bar fell full
      and direct upon the head of Biscarrat, who was dead before he had ended
      his cry. Then the formidable lever rose ten times in ten seconds, and made
      ten corpses. The soldiers could see nothing; they heard sighs and groans;
      they stumbled over dead bodies, but as they had no conception of the cause
      of all this, they came forward jostling each other. The implacable bar,
      still falling, annihilated the first platoon, without a single sound to
      warn the second, which was quietly advancing; only, commanded by the
      captain, the men had stripped a fir, growing on the shore, and, with its
      resinous branches twisted together, the captain had made a flambeau. On
      arriving at the compartment where Porthos, like the exterminating angel,
      had destroyed all he touched, the first rank drew back in terror. No
      firing had replied to that of the guards, and yet their way was stopped by
      a heap of dead bodies&mdash;they literally walked in blood. Porthos was
      still behind his pillar. The captain, illumining with trembling pine-torch
      this frightful carnage, of which he in vain sought the cause, drew back
      towards the pillar behind which Porthos was concealed. Then a gigantic
      hand issued from the shade, and fastened on the throat of the captain, who
      uttered a stifle rattle; his stretched-out arms beating the air, the torch
      fell and was extinguished in blood. A second after, the corpse of the
      captain dropped close to the extinguished torch, and added another body to
      the heap of dead which blocked up the passage. All this was effected as
      mysteriously as though by magic. At hearing the rattling in the throat of
      the captain, the soldiers who accompanied him had turned round, caught a
      glimpse of his extended arms, his eyes starting from their sockets, and
      then the torch fell and they were left in darkness. From an unreflective,
      instinctive, mechanical feeling, the lieutenant cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately a volley of musketry flamed, thundered, roared in the cavern,
      bringing down enormous fragments from the vaults. The cavern was lighted
      for an instant by this discharge, and then immediately returned to pitchy
      darkness rendered thicker by the smoke. To this succeeded a profound
      silence, broken only by the steps of the third brigade, now entering the
      cavern.

    <h2>
      Chapter L: The Death of a Titan.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the moment when Porthos, more accustomed to the darkness than these
      men, coming from open daylight, was looking round him to see if through
      this artificial midnight Aramis were not making him some signal, he felt
      his arm gently touched, and a voice low as a breath murmured in his ear,
      &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Aramis, if possible, yet more softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And amidst the noise of the third brigade, which continued to advance, the
      imprecations of the guards still left alive, the muffled groans of the
      dying, Aramis and Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of the
      cavern. Aramis led Porthos into the last but one compartment, and showed
      him, in a hollow of the rocky wall, a barrel of powder weighing from
      seventy to eighty pounds, to which he had just attached a fuse. &ldquo;My
      friend,&rdquo; said he to Porthos, &ldquo;you will take this barrel, the match of
      which I am going to set fire to, and throw it amidst our enemies; can you
      do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>&rdquo; replied Porthos; and he lifted the barrel with one hand.
      &ldquo;Light it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;till they are all massed together, and then, my
      Jupiter, hurl your thunderbolt among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light it,&rdquo; repeated Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my part,&rdquo; continued Aramis, &ldquo;I will join our Bretons, and help them to
      get the canoe to the sea. I will wait for you on the shore; launch it
      strongly, and hasten to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light it,&rdquo; said Porthos, a third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said Porthos again, with laughter that he did not even
      attempt to restrain, &ldquo;when a thing is explained to me I understand it;
      begone, and give me the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis gave the burning match to Porthos, who held out his arm to him, his
      hands being engaged. Aramis pressed the arm of Porthos with both his
      hands, and fell back to the outlet of the cavern where the three rowers
      awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, left alone, applied the spark bravely to the match. The spark&mdash;a
      feeble spark, first principle of conflagration&mdash;shone in the darkness
      like a glow-worm, then was deadened against the match which it set fire
      to, Porthos enlivening the flame with his breath. The smoke was a little
      dispersed, and by the light of the sparkling match objects might, for two
      seconds, be distinguished. It was a brief but splendid spectacle, that of
      this giant, pale, bloody, his countenance lighted by the fire of the match
      burning in surrounding darkness! The soldiers saw him, they saw the barrel
      he held in his hand&mdash;they at once understood what was going to
      happen. Then, these men, already choked with horror at the sight of what
      had been accomplished, filled with terror at thought of what was about to
      be accomplished, gave out a simultaneous shriek of agony. Some endeavored
      to fly, but they encountered the third brigade, which barred their
      passage; others mechanically took aim and attempted to fire their
      discharged muskets; others fell instinctively upon their knees. Two or
      three officers cried out to Porthos to promise him his liberty if he would
      spare their lives. The lieutenant of the third brigade commanded his men
      to fire; but the guards had before them their terrified companions, who
      served as a living rampart for Porthos. We have said that the light
      produced by the spark and the match did not last more than two seconds;
      but during these two seconds this is what it illumined: in the first
      place, the giant, enlarged in the darkness; then, at ten paces off, a heap
      of bleeding bodies, crushed, mutilated, in the midst of which some still
      heaved in the last agony, lifting the mass as a last respiration inflating
      the sides of some old monster dying in the night. Every breath of Porthos,
      thus vivifying the match, sent towards this heap of bodies a
      phosphorescent aura, mingled with streaks of purple. In addition to this
      principal group scattered about the grotto, as the chances of death or
      surprise had stretched them, isolated bodies seemed to be making ghastly
      exhibitions of their gaping wounds. Above ground, bedded in pools of
      blood, rose, heavy and sparkling, the short, thick pillars of the cavern,
      of which the strongly marked shades threw out the luminous particles. And
      all this was seen by the tremulous light of a match attached to a barrel
      of powder, that is to say, a torch which, whilst throwing a light on the
      dead past, showed death to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, this spectacle did not last above two seconds. During this
      short space of time an officer of the third brigade got together eight men
      armed with muskets, and, through an opening, ordered them to fire upon
      Porthos. But they who received the order to fire trembled so that three
      guards fell by the discharge, and the five remaining balls hissed on to
      splinter the vault, plow the ground, or indent the pillars of the cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of laughter replied to this volley; then the arm of the giant
      swung round; then was seen whirling through the air, like a falling star,
      the train of fire. The barrel, hurled a distance of thirty feet, cleared
      the barricade of dead bodies, and fell amidst a group of shrieking
      soldiers, who threw themselves on their faces. The officer had followed
      the brilliant train in the air; he endeavored to precipitate himself upon
      the barrel and tear out the match before it reached the powder it
      contained. Useless! The air had made the flame attached to the conductor
      more active; the match, which at rest might have burnt five minutes, was
      consumed in thirty seconds, and the infernal work exploded. Furious
      vortices of sulphur and nitre, devouring shoals of fire which caught every
      object, the terrible thunder of the explosion, this is what the second
      which followed disclosed in that cavern of horrors. The rocks split like
      planks of deal beneath the axe. A jet of fire, smoke, and <i>debris</i>
      sprang from the middle of the grotto, enlarging as it mounted. The large
      walls of silex tottered and fell upon the sand, and the sand itself, an
      instrument of pain when launched from its hard bed, riddled the faces with
      its myriad cutting atoms. Shrieks, imprecations, human life, dead bodies&mdash;all
      were engulfed in one terrific crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three first compartments became one sepulchral sink into which fell
      grimly back, in the order of their weight, every vegetable, mineral, or
      human fragment. Then the lighter sand and ash came down in turn,
      stretching like a winding sheet and smoking over the dismal scene. And
      now, in this burning tomb, this subterranean volcano, seek the king&rsquo;s
      guards with their blue coats laced with silver. Seek the officers,
      brilliant in gold, seek for the arms upon which they depended for their
      defense. One single man has made of all of those things a chaos more
      confused, more shapeless, more terrible than the chaos which existed
      before the creation of the world. There remained nothing of the three
      compartments&mdash;nothing by which God could have recognized His
      handiwork. As for Porthos, after having hurled the barrel of powder amidst
      his enemies, he had fled, as Aramis had directed him to do, and had gained
      the last compartment, into which air, light, and sunshine penetrated
      through the opening. Scarcely had he turned the angle which separated the
      third compartment from the fourth when he perceived at a hundred paces
      from him the bark dancing on the waves. There were his friends, there
      liberty, there life and victory. Six more of his formidable strides, and
      he would be out of the vault; out of the vault! a dozen of his vigorous
      leaps and he would reach the canoe. Suddenly he felt his knees give way;
      his knees seemed powerless, his legs to yield beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;there is my weakness seizing me again! I can walk
      no further! What is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis perceived him through the opening, and unable to conceive what
      could induce him to stop thus&mdash;&ldquo;Come on, Porthos! come on,&rdquo; he cried;
      &ldquo;come quickly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the giant, making an effort that contorted every muscle of
      his body&mdash;&ldquo;oh! but I cannot.&rdquo; While saying these words, he fell upon
      his knees, but with his mighty hands he clung to the rocks, and raised
      himself up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! quick!&rdquo; repeated Aramis, bending forward towards the shore, as if
      to draw Porthos towards him with his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; stammered Porthos, collecting all his strength to make one
      step more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Heaven! Porthos, make haste! the barrel will blow up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste, monseigneur!&rdquo; shouted the Bretons to Porthos, who was
      floundering as in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no time; the explosion thundered, earth gaped, the smoke
      which hurled through the clefts obscured the sky; the sea flowed back as
      though driven by the blast of flame which darted from the grotto as if
      from the jaws of some gigantic fiery chimera; the reflux took the bark out
      twenty <i>toises</i>; the solid rocks cracked to their base, and separated
      like blocks beneath the operation of the wedge; a portion of the vault was
      carried up towards heaven, as if it had been built of cardboard; the green
      and blue and topaz conflagration and black lava of liquefactions clashed
      and combated an instant beneath a majestic dome of smoke; then oscillated,
      declined, and fell successively the mighty monoliths of rock which the
      violence of the explosion had not been able to uproot from the bed of
      ages; they bowed to each other like grave and stiff old men, then
      prostrating themselves, lay down forever in their dusty tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      This frightful shock seemed to restore Porthos the strength that he had
      lost; he arose, a giant among granite giants. But at the moment he was
      flying between the double hedge of granite phantoms, these latter, which
      were no longer supported by the corresponding links, began to roll and
      totter round our Titan, who looked as if precipitated from heaven amidst
      rocks which he had just been launching. Porthos felt the very earth
      beneath his feet becoming jelly-tremulous. He stretched both hands to
      repulse the falling rocks. A gigantic block was held back by each of his
      extended arms. He bent his head, and a third granite mass sank between his
      shoulders. For an instant the power of Porthos seemed about to fail him,
      but this new Hercules united all his force, and the two walls of the
      prison in which he was buried fell back slowly and gave him place. For an
      instant he appeared, in this frame of granite, like the angel of chaos,
      but in pushing back the lateral rocks, he lost his point of support, for
      the monolith which weighed upon his shoulders, and the boulder, pressing
      upon him with all its weight, brought the giant down upon his knees. The
      lateral rocks, for an instant pushed back, drew together again, and added
      their weight to the ponderous mass which would have been sufficient to
      crush ten men. The hero fell without a groan&mdash;he fell while answering
      Aramis with words of encouragement and hope, for, thanks to the powerful
      arch of his hands, for an instant he believed that, like Enceladus, he
      would succeed in shaking off the triple load. But by degrees Aramis beheld
      the block sink; the hands, strung for an instant, the arms stiffened for a
      last effort, gave way, the extended shoulders sank, wounded and torn, and
      the rocks continued to gradually collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos! Porthos!&rdquo; cried Aramis, tearing his hair. &ldquo;Porthos! where are
      you? Speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, here,&rdquo; murmured Porthos, with a voice growing evidently weaker,
      &ldquo;patience! patience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he pronounced these words, when the impulse of the fall
      augmented the weight; the enormous rock sank down, pressed by those others
      which sank in from the sides, and, as it were, swallowed up Porthos in a
      sepulcher of badly jointed stones. On hearing the dying voice of his
      friend, Aramis had sprung to land. Two of the Bretons followed him, with
      each a lever in his hand&mdash;one being sufficient to take care of the
      bark. The dying rattle of the valiant gladiator guided them amidst the
      ruins. Aramis, animated, active and young as at twenty, sprang towards the
      triple mass, and with his hands, delicate as those of a woman, raised by a
      miracle of strength the corner-stone of this great granite grave. Then he
      caught a glimpse, through the darkness of that charnel-house, of the still
      brilliant eye of his friend, to whom the momentary lifting of the mass
      restored a momentary respiration. The two men came rushing up, grasped
      their iron levers, united their triple strength, not merely to raise it,
      but sustain it. All was useless. They gave way with cries of grief, and
      the rough voice of Porthos, seeing them exhaust themselves in a useless
      struggle, murmured in an almost cheerful tone those supreme words which
      came to his lips with the last respiration, &ldquo;Too heavy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After which his eyes darkened and closed, his face grew ashy pale, the
      hands whitened, and the colossus sank quite down, breathing his last sigh.
      With him sank the rock, which, even in his dying agony he had still held
      up. The three men dropped the levers, which rolled upon the tumulary
      stone. Then, breathless, pale, his brow covered with sweat, Aramis
      listened, his breast oppressed, his heart ready to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more. The giant slept the eternal sleep, in the sepulcher which
      God had built about him to his measure.

    <h2>
      Chapter LI. Porthos&rsquo;s Epitaph.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aramis, silent and sad as ice, trembling like a timid child, arose
      shivering from the stone. A Christian does not walk on tombs. But, though
      capable of standing, he was not capable of walking. It might be said that
      something of dead Porthos had just died within him. His Bretons surrounded
      him; Aramis yielded to their kind exertions, and the three sailors,
      lifting him up, carried him to the canoe. Then, having laid him down upon
      the bench near the rudder, they took to their oars, preferring this to
      hoisting sail, which might betray them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On all that leveled surface of the ancient grotto of Locmaria, one single
      hillock attracted their eyes. Aramis never removed his from it; and, at a
      distance out in the sea, in proportion as the shore receded, that menacing
      proud mass of rock seemed to draw itself up, as formerly Porthos used to
      draw himself up, raising a smiling, yet invincible head towards heaven,
      like that of his dear old honest valiant friend, the strongest of the
      four, yet the first dead. Strange destiny of these men of brass! The most
      simple of heart allied to the most crafty; strength of body guided by
      subtlety of mind; and in the decisive moment, when vigor alone could save
      mind and body, a stone, a rock, a vile material weight, triumphed over
      manly strength, and falling upon the body, drove out the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worthy Porthos! born to help other men, always ready to sacrifice himself
      for the safety of the weak, as if God had only given him strength for that
      purpose; when dying he only thought he was carrying out the conditions of
      his compact with Aramis, a compact, however, which Aramis alone had drawn
      up, and which Porthos had only known to suffer by its terrible solidarity.
      Noble Porthos! of what good now are thy chateaux overflowing with
      sumptuous furniture, forests overflowing with game, lakes overflowing with
      fish, cellars overflowing with wealth! Of what service to thee now thy
      lackeys in brilliant liveries, and in the midst of them Mousqueton, proud
      of the power delegated by thee! Oh, noble Porthos! careful heaper-up of
      treasure, was it worth while to labor to sweeten and gild life, to come
      upon a desert shore, surrounded by the cries of seagulls, and lay thyself,
      with broken bones, beneath a torpid stone? Was it worth while, in short,
      noble Porthos, to heap so much gold, and not have even the distich of a
      poor poet engraven upon thy monument? Valiant Porthos! he still, without
      doubt, sleeps, lost, forgotten, beneath the rock the shepherds of the
      heath take for the gigantic abode of a <i>dolmen</i>. And so many twining
      branches, so many mosses, bent by the bitter wind of ocean, so many
      lichens solder thy sepulcher to earth, that no passers-by will imagine
      such a block of granite could ever have been supported by the shoulders of
      one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, still pale, still icy-cold, his heart upon his lips, looked, even
      till, with the last ray of daylight, the shore faded on the horizon. Not a
      word escaped him, not a sigh rose from his deep breast. The superstitious
      Bretons looked upon him, trembling. Such silence was not that of a man, it
      was the silence of a statue. In the meantime, with the first gray lines
      that lighted up the heavens, the canoe hoisted its little sail, which,
      swelling with the kisses of the breeze, and carrying them rapidly from the
      coast, made bravest way towards Spain, across the dreaded Gulf of Gascony,
      so rife with storms. But scarcely half an hour after the sail had been
      hoisted, the rowers became inactive, reclining on their benches, and,
      making an eye-shade with their hands, pointed out to each other a white
      spot which appeared on the horizon as motionless as a gull rocked by the
      viewless respiration of the waves. But that which might have appeared
      motionless to ordinary eyes was moving at a quick rate to the experienced
      eye of the sailor; that which appeared stationary upon the ocean was
      cutting a rapid way through it. For some time, seeing the profound torpor
      in which their master was plunged, they did not dare to rouse him, and
      satisfied themselves with exchanging their conjectures in whispers.
      Aramis, in fact, so vigilant, so active&mdash;Aramis, whose eye, like that
      of the lynx, watched without ceasing, and saw better by night than by day&mdash;Aramis
      seemed to sleep in this despair of soul. An hour passed thus, during which
      daylight gradually disappeared, but during which also the sail in view
      gained so swiftly on the bark, that Goenne, one of the three sailors,
      ventured to say aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, we are being chased!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis made no reply; the ship still gained upon them. Then, of their own
      accord, two of the sailors, by the direction of the patron Yves, lowered
      the sail, in order that that single point upon the surface of the waters
      should cease to be a guide to the eye of the enemy pursuing them. On the
      part of the ship in sight, on the contrary, two more small sails were run
      up at the extremities of the masts. Unfortunately, it was the time of the
      finest and longest days of the year, and the moon, in all her brilliancy,
      succeeded inauspicious daylight. The <i>balancelle</i>, which was pursuing
      the little bark before the wind, had then still half an hour of twilight,
      and a whole night almost as light as day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur! monseigneur! we are lost!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Look! they see
      us plainly, though we have lowered sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not to be wondered at,&rdquo; murmured one of the sailors, &ldquo;since they
      say that, by the aid of the devil, the Paris-folk have fabricated
      instruments with which they see as well at a distance as near, by night as
      well as by day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis took a telescope from the bottom of the boat, focussed it silently,
      and passing it to the sailor, &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;look!&rdquo; The sailor
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; said the bishop, &ldquo;there is no sin in it; and if there
      is any sin, I will take it on myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor lifted the glass to his eye, and uttered a cry. He believed
      that the vessel, which appeared to be distant about cannon-shot, had at a
      single bound cleared the whole distance. But, on withdrawing the
      instrument from his eye, he saw that, except the way which the <i>balancelle</i>
      had been able to make during that brief instant, it was still at the same
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; murmured the sailor, &ldquo;they can see us as we see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They see us,&rdquo; said Aramis, and sank again into impassibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&mdash;they see us!&rdquo; said Yves. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain, look yourself,&rdquo; said the sailor. And he passed him the
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?&rdquo; asked
      Yves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper lifted the glass to his eye. &ldquo;Oh! monseigneur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
      is a miracle&mdash;there they are; it seems as if I were going to touch
      them. Twenty-five men at least! Ah! I see the captain forward. He holds a
      glass like this, and is looking at us. Ah! he turns round, and gives an
      order; they are rolling a piece of cannon forward&mdash;they are loading
      it&mdash;pointing it. <i>Misericorde!</i> they are firing at us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And by a mechanical movement, the skipper put aside the telescope, and the
      pursuing ship, relegated to the horizon, appeared again in its true
      aspect. The vessel was still at the distance of nearly a league, but the
      maneuver sighted thus was not less real. A light cloud of smoke appeared
      beneath the sails, more blue than they, and spreading like a flower
      opening; then, at about a mile from the little canoe, they saw the ball
      take the crown off two or three waves, dig a white furrow in the sea, and
      disappear at the end of it, as inoffensive as the stone with which, in
      play, a boy makes ducks and drakes. It was at once a menace and a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; asked the patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will sink us!&rdquo; said Goenne, &ldquo;give us absolution, monseigneur!&rdquo; And
      the sailors fell on their knees before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that they can see you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true!&rdquo; said the sailors, ashamed of their weakness. &ldquo;Give us your
      orders, monseigneur, we are prepared to die for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us wait,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;let us wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; do you not see, as you just now said, that if we endeavor to fly,
      they will sink us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, perhaps,&rdquo; the patron ventured to say, &ldquo;perhaps under cover of night,
      we could escape them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;they have, no doubt, Greek fire with which to lighten
      their own course and ours likewise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, as if the vessel was responsive to the appeal of
      Aramis, a second cloud of smoke mounted slowly to the heavens, and from
      the bosom of that cloud sparkled an arrow of flame, which described a
      parabola like a rainbow, and fell into the sea, where it continued to
      burn, illuminating a space of a quarter of a league in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bretons looked at each other in terror. &ldquo;You see plainly,&rdquo; said
      Aramis, &ldquo;it will be better to wait for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The oars dropped from the hands of the sailors, and the bark, ceasing to
      make way, rocked motionless upon the summits of the waves. Night came on,
      but still the ship drew nearer. It might be imagined it redoubled its
      speed with darkness. From time to time, as a vulture rears its head out of
      its nest, the formidable Greek fire darted from its sides, and cast its
      flame upon the ocean like an incandescent snowfall. At last it came within
      musket-shot. All the men were on deck, arms in hand; the cannoniers were
      at their guns, the matches burning. It might be thought they were about to
      board a frigate and to fight a crew superior in number to their own, not
      to attempt the capture of a canoe manned by four people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; cried the commander of the <i>balancelle</i>, with the aid of
      his speaking-trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailors looked at Aramis. Aramis made a sign with his head. Yves waved
      a white cloth at the end of a gaff. This was like striking their flag. The
      pursuer came on like a race-horse. It launched a fresh Greek fire, which
      fell within twenty paces of the little canoe, and threw a light upon them
      as white as sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the first sign of resistance,&rdquo; cried the commander of the <i>balancelle</i>,
      &ldquo;fire!&rdquo; The soldiers brought their muskets to the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we not say we surrendered?&rdquo; said Yves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive, alive, captain!&rdquo; cried one excited soldier, &ldquo;they must be taken
      alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;living,&rdquo; said the captain. Then turning towards the
      Bretons, &ldquo;Your lives are safe, my friends!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;all but the
      Chevalier d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis stared imperceptibly. For an instant his eye was fixed upon the
      depths of the ocean, illumined by the last flashes of the Greek fire,
      which ran along the sides of the waves, played on the crests like plumes,
      and rendered still darker and more terrible the gulfs they covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear, monseigneur?&rdquo; said the sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis leaned still more forward, and dipped the ends of his long white
      fingers in the green limpid waters of the sea, to which he turned with
      smiles as to a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept!&rdquo; repeated he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We accept,&rdquo; repeated the sailors; &ldquo;but what security have we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word of a gentleman,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;By my rank and by my name I
      swear that all except M. le Chevalier d&rsquo;Herblay shall have their lives
      spared. I am lieutenant of the king&rsquo;s frigate the &lsquo;Pomona,&rsquo; and my name is
      Louis Constant de Pressigny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a rapid gesture, Aramis&mdash;already bent over the side of the bark
      towards the sea&mdash;drew himself up, and with a flashing eye, and a
      smile upon his lips, &ldquo;Throw out the ladder, messieurs,&rdquo; said he, as if the
      command had belonged to him. He was obeyed. When Aramis, seizing the rope
      ladder, walked straight up to the commander, with a firm step, looked at
      him earnestly, made a sign to him with his hand, a mysterious and unknown
      sign at sight of which the officer turned pale, trembled, and bowed his
      head, the sailors were profoundly astonished. Without a word Aramis then
      raised his hand to the eyes of the commander and showed him the collet of
      a ring he wore on the ring-finger of his left hand. And while making this
      sign Aramis, draped in cold and haughty majesty, had the air of an emperor
      giving his hand to be kissed. The commandant, who for a moment had raised
      his head, bowed a second time with marks of the most profound respect.
      Then stretching his hand out, in his turn, towards the poop, that is to
      say, towards his own cabin, he drew back to allow Aramis to go first. The
      three Bretons, who had come on board after their bishop, looked at each
      other, stupefied. The crew were awed to silence. Five minutes after, the
      commander called the second lieutenant, who returned immediately, ordering
      the head to be put towards Corunna. Whilst this order was being executed,
      Aramis reappeared upon the deck, and took a seat near the <i>bastingage</i>.
      Night had fallen; the moon had not yet risen, yet Aramis looked
      incessantly towards Belle-Isle. Yves then approached the captain, who had
      returned to take his post in the stern, and said, in a low and humble
      voice, &ldquo;What course are we to follow, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We take what course monseigneur pleases,&rdquo; replied the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis passed the night leaning upon the <i>bastingage</i>. Yves, on
      approaching him next morning, remarked that &ldquo;the night must have been a
      very damp one, for the wood on which the bishop&rsquo;s head had rested was
      soaked with dew.&rdquo; Who knows?&mdash;that dew was, it may be, the first
      tears that had ever fallen from the eyes of Aramis!
    </p>
    <p>
      What epitaph would have been worth that, good Porthos?

    <h2>
      Chapter LII. M. de Gesvres&rsquo;s Round.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was little used to resistance like that he had just
      experienced. He returned, profoundly irritated, to Nantes. Irritation,
      with this vigorous man, usually vented itself in impetuous attack, which
      few people, hitherto, were they king, were they giants, had been able to
      resist. Trembling with rage, he went straight to the castle, and asked an
      audience with the king. It might be about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
      and, since his arrival at Nantes, the king had been an early riser. But on
      arriving at the corridor with which we are acquainted, D&rsquo;Artagnan found M.
      de Gesvres, who stopped him politely, telling him not to speak too loud
      and disturb the king. &ldquo;Is the king asleep?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Well, I will
      let him sleep. But about what o&rsquo;clock do you suppose he will rise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! in about two hours; his majesty has been up all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan took his hat again, bowed to M. de Gesvres, and returned to his
      own apartments. He came back at half-past nine, and was told that the king
      was at breakfast. &ldquo;That will just suit me,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;I will talk
      to the king while he is eating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Brienne reminded D&rsquo;Artagnan that the king would not see any one at
      meal-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, looking askant at Brienne, &ldquo;you do not know,
      perhaps, monsieur, that I have the privilege of <i>entree</i> anywhere&mdash;and
      at any hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brienne took the captain&rsquo;s hand kindly, and said, &ldquo;Not at Nantes, dear
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan. The king, in this journey, has changed everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, a little softened, asked about what o&rsquo;clock the king would
      have finished his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&mdash;don&rsquo;t know! What does that mean? You don&rsquo;t know how much time
      the king devotes to eating? It is generally an hour; and, if we admit that
      the air of the Loire gives an additional appetite, we will extend it to an
      hour and a half; that is enough, I think. I will wait where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, the order of the day is not to allow any
      person to remain in this corridor; I am on guard for that particular
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan felt his anger mounting to his brain a second time. He went out
      quickly, for fear of complicating the affair by a display of premature
      ill-humor. As soon as he was out he began to reflect. &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;will not receive me, that is evident. The young man is angry; he is
      afraid, beforehand, of the words that I may speak to him. Yes; but in the
      meantime Belle-Isle is besieged, and my two friends by now probably taken
      or killed. Poor Porthos! As to Master Aramis, he is always full of
      resources, and I am easy on his account. But, no, no; Porthos is not yet
      an invalid, nor is Aramis in his dotage. The one with his arm, the other
      with his imagination, will find work for his majesty&rsquo;s soldiers. Who knows
      if these brave men may not get up for the edification of his most
      Christian majesty a little bastion of Saint-Gervais! I don&rsquo;t despair of
      it. They have cannon and a garrison. And yet,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know whether it would not be better to stop the combat. For myself
      alone I will not put up with either surly looks or insults from the king;
      but for my friends I must put up with everything. Shall I go to M.
      Colbert? Now, there is a man I must acquire the habit of terrifying. I
      will go to M. Colbert.&rdquo; And D&rsquo;Artagnan set forward bravely to find M.
      Colbert, but was informed that he was working with the king, at the castle
      of Nantes. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the times have come again in which I
      measured my steps from De Treville to the cardinal, from the cardinal to
      the queen, from the queen to Louis XIII. Truly is it said that men, in
      growing old, become children again!&mdash;To the castle, then!&rdquo; He
      returned thither. M. de Lyonne was coming out. He gave D&rsquo;Artagnan both
      hands, but told him that the king had been busy all the preceding evening
      and all night, and that orders had been given that no one should be
      admitted. &ldquo;Not even the captain who takes the order?&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;I
      think that is rather too strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even he,&rdquo; said M. de Lyonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that is the case,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, wounded to the heart; &ldquo;since
      the captain of the musketeers, who has always entered the king&rsquo;s chamber,
      is no longer allowed to enter it, his cabinet, or his <i>salle-a-manger</i>,
      either the king is dead, or his captain is in disgrace. Do me the favor,
      then, M. de Lyonne, who are in favor, to return and tell the king,
      plainly, I send him my resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan, beware of what you are doing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For friendship&rsquo;s sake, go!&rdquo; and he pushed him gently towards the cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will go,&rdquo; said Lyonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan waited, walking about the corridor in no enviable mood. Lyonne
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did the king say?&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He simply answered, &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Lyonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was well!&rdquo; said the captain, with an explosion. &ldquo;That is to say,
      that he accepts it? Good! Now, then, I am free! I am only a plain citizen,
      M. de Lyonne. I have the pleasure of bidding you good-bye! Farewell,
      castle, corridor, ante-chamber! a <i>bourgeois</i>, about to breathe at
      liberty, takes his farewell of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without waiting longer, the captain sprang from the terrace down the
      staircase, where he had picked up the fragments of Gourville&rsquo;s letter.
      Five minutes after, he was at the hostelry, where, according to the custom
      of all great officers who have lodgings at the castle, he had taken what
      was called his city-chamber. But when he arrived there, instead of
      throwing off his sword and cloak, he took his pistols, put his money into
      a large leather purse, sent for his horses from the castle-stables, and
      gave orders that would ensure their reaching Vannes during the night.
      Everything went on according to his wishes. At eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      evening, he was putting his foot in the stirrup, when M. de Gesvres
      appeared, at the head of twelve guards, in front of the hostelry.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan saw all from the corner of his eye; he could not fail seeing
      thirteen men and thirteen horses. But he feigned not to observe anything,
      and was about to put his horse in motion. Gesvres rode up to him.
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; said he, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur de Gesvres! good evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would say you were getting on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that,&mdash;I am mounted,&mdash;as you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate I have met with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you looking for me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the part of the king, I will wager?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I, three days ago, went in search of M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! It is of no use being over-delicate with me; that is all labor
      lost. Tell me at once you are come to arrest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arrest you?&mdash;Good heavens! no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you come to accost me with twelve horsemen at your heels, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am making my round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t bad! And so you pick me up in your round, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pick you up; I meet with you, and I beg you to come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a bantering air; &ldquo;the king is disengaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, captain,&rdquo; said M. de Gesvres, in a low voice to the
      musketeer, &ldquo;do not compromise yourself! these men hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan laughed aloud, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March! People who are arrested are placed between the six first guards
      and the six last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as I am not arresting you,&rdquo; said M. de Gesvres, &ldquo;you will march
      behind, with me, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;that is very polite, duke, and you are right in
      being so; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your <i>chambre-de-ville</i>,
      I should have been courteous to you, I assure you, on the word of a
      gentleman! Now, one favor more; what does the king want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the king is furious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! the king, who has thought it worth while to be angry, may take
      the trouble to grow calm again; that is all. I shan&rsquo;t die of that, I will
      swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet. <i>Mordioux!</i>
      That is a gallant man, a worthy man! We shall live very sociably together,
      I will be sworn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are at our place of destination,&rdquo; said the duke. &ldquo;Captain, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake be calm with the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! you are playing the brave man with me, duke!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      throwing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres. &ldquo;I have been told that
      you are ambitious of uniting your guards with my musketeers. This strikes
      me as a splendid opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for many reasons&mdash;in the first place, for this: if I were to
      succeed you in the musketeers after having arrested you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then you admit you have arrested me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say met me, then. So, you were saying <i>if</i> you were to succeed me
      after having arrested me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your musketeers, at the first exercise with ball cartridges, would fire
      <i>my</i> way, by mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to that I won&rsquo;t say; for the fellows <i>do</i> love me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gesvres made D&rsquo;Artagnan pass in first, and took him straight to the
      cabinet where Louis was waiting for his captain of the musketeers, and
      placed himself behind his colleague in the ante-chamber. The king could be
      heard distinctly, speaking aloud to Colbert in the same cabinet where
      Colbert might have heard, a few days before, the king speaking aloud with
      M. d&rsquo;Artagnan. The guards remained as a mounted picket before the
      principal gate; and the report was quickly spread throughout the city that
      monsieur le capitaine of the musketeers had been arrested by order of the
      king. Then these men were seen to be in motion, and as in the good old
      times of Louis XIII. and M. de Treville, groups were formed, and
      staircases were filled; vague murmurs, issuing from the court below, came
      rolling to the upper stories, like the distant moaning of the waves. M. de
      Gesvres became uneasy. He looked at his guards, who, after being
      interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among their ranks, began
      to shun them with a manifestation of innocence. D&rsquo;Artagnan was certainly
      less disturbed by all this than M. de Gesvres, the captain of the guards.
      As soon as he entered, he seated himself on the ledge of a window whence
      with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on without the least
      emotion. No step of the progressive fermentation which had shown itself at
      the report of his arrest escaped him. He foresaw the very moment the
      explosion would take place; and we know that his previsions were in
      general correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very whimsical,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;if, this evening, my
      praetorians should make me king of France. How I should laugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, at the height, all was stopped. Guards, musketeers, officers,
      soldiers, murmurs, uneasiness, dispersed, vanished, died away; there was
      an end of menace and sedition. One word had calmed the waves. The king had
      desired Brienne to say, &ldquo;Hush, messieurs! you disturb the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan sighed. &ldquo;All is over!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the musketeers of the present
      day are not those of his majesty Louis XIII. All is over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, you are wanted in the ante-chamber of the king,&rdquo;
       proclaimed an usher.

    <h2>
      Chapter LIII. King Louis XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king was seated in his cabinet, with his back turned towards the door
      of entrance. In front of him was a mirror, in which, while turning over
      his papers, he could see at a glance those who came in. He did not take
      any notice of the entrance of D&rsquo;Artagnan, but spread above his letters and
      plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets from the
      importunate. D&rsquo;Artagnan understood this by-play, and kept in the
      background; so that at the end of a minute the king, who heard nothing,
      and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye, was obliged to cry, &ldquo;Is
      not M. d&rsquo;Artagnan there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, sire,&rdquo; replied the musketeer, advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; said the king, fixing his pellucid eyes on D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      &ldquo;what have you to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, sire!&rdquo; replied the latter, who watched the first blow of his adversary
      to make a good retort; &ldquo;I have nothing to say to your majesty, unless it
      be that you have caused me to be arrested, and here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was going to reply that he had not had D&rsquo;Artagnan arrested, but
      any such sentence appeared too much like an excuse, and he was silent.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan likewise preserved an obstinate silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; at length resumed the king, &ldquo;what did I charge you to go and
      do at Belle-Isle? Tell me, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king while uttering these words looked intently at his captain. Here
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was fortunate; the king seemed to place the game in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that your majesty does me the honor to ask what
      I went to Belle-Isle to accomplish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! sire, I know nothing about it; it is not of me that question should
      be asked, but of that infinite number of officers of all kinds, to whom
      have been given innumerable orders of all kinds, whilst to me, head of the
      expedition, nothing precise was said or stated in any form whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was hurt: he showed it by his reply. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;orders
      have only been given to such as were judged faithful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, therefore, I have been astonished, sire,&rdquo; retorted the musketeer,
      &ldquo;that a captain like myself, who ranks with a marechal of France, should
      have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or majors,
      good to make spies of, possibly, but not at all fit to conduct a warlike
      expedition. It was upon this subject I came to demand an explanation of
      your majesty, when I found the door closed against me, which, the final
      insult offered to a brave man, has led me to quit your majesty&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;you still believe that you are living in an
      age when kings were, as you complain of having been, under the orders and
      at the discretion of their inferiors. You seem to forget that a king owes
      an account of his actions to none but God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget nothing, sire,&rdquo; said the musketeer, wounded by this lesson.
      &ldquo;Besides, I do not see in what an honest man, when he asks of his king how
      he has ill-served him, offends him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ill-served me, monsieur, by siding with my enemies against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are your enemies, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men I sent you to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two men the enemies of the whole of your majesty&rsquo;s army! That is
      incredible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no power to judge of my will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have to judge of my own friendships, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who serves his friends does not serve his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I so well understand this, sire, that I have respectfully offered your
      majesty my resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have accepted it, monsieur,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Before being separated
      from you I was willing to prove to you that I know how to keep my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty has kept more than your word, for your majesty has had me
      arrested,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, with his cold, bantering air; &ldquo;you did not
      promise me that, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry, and continued,
      seriously, &ldquo;You see, monsieur, to what grave steps your disobedience
      forces me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My disobedience!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, red with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the mildest term that I can find,&rdquo; pursued the king. &ldquo;My idea was
      to take and punish rebels; was I bound to inquire whether these rebels
      were your friends or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;It was a cruelty on your majesty&rsquo;s part
      to send me to capture my friends and lead them to your gibbets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a trial I had to make, monsieur, of pretended servants, who eat my
      bread and <i>should</i> defend my person. The trial has succeeded ill,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one bad servant your majesty loses,&rdquo; said the musketeer, with
      bitterness, &ldquo;there are ten who, on that same day, go through a like
      ordeal. Listen to me, sire; I am not accustomed to that service. Mine is a
      rebel sword when I am required to do ill. It was ill to send me in pursuit
      of two men whose lives M. Fouquet, your majesty&rsquo;s preserver, implored you
      to save. Still further, these men were my friends. They did not attack
      your majesty, they succumbed to your blind anger. Besides, why were they
      not allowed to escape? What crime had they committed? I admit you may
      contest with me the right of judging their conduct. But why suspect me
      before the action? Why surround me with spies? Why disgrace me before the
      army? Why me, in whom till now you showed the most entire confidence&mdash;who
      for thirty years have been attached to your person, and have given you a
      thousand proofs of my devotion&mdash;for it must be said, now that I am
      accused&mdash;why reduce me to see three thousand of the king&rsquo;s soldiers
      march in battle against two men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me!&rdquo; said
      the king, in a hollow voice, &ldquo;and that it was no merit of theirs I was not
      lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, one would imagine you forget that I was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, enough of these dominating interests which
      arise to keep the sun itself from my interests. I am founding a state in
      which there shall be but one master, as I promised you; the moment is at
      hand for me to keep my promise. You wish to be, according to your tastes
      or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies? I
      will thwart you or will drop you&mdash;seek a more compliant master. I
      know full well that another king would not conduct himself as I do, and
      would allow himself to be dominated by you, at the risk of sending you
      some day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest; but I have an
      excellent memory, and for me, services are sacred titles to gratitude, to
      impunity. You shall only have this lesson, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, as the
      punishment of your want of discipline, and I will not imitate my
      predecessors in anger, not having imitated them in favor. And, then, other
      reasons make me act mildly towards you; in the first place, because you
      are a man of sense, a man of excellent sense, a man of heart, and that you
      will be a capital servant to him who shall have mastered you; secondly,
      because you will cease to have any motives for insubordination. Your
      friends are now destroyed or ruined by me. These supports on which your
      capricious mind instinctively relied I have caused to disappear. At this
      moment, my soldiers have taken or killed the rebels of Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan became pale. &ldquo;Taken or killed!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Oh! sire, if you
      thought what you tell, if you were sure you were telling me the truth, I
      should forget all that is just, all that is magnanimous in your words, to
      call you a barbarous king, and an unnatural man. But I pardon you these
      words,&rdquo; said he, smiling with pride; &ldquo;I pardon them to a young prince who
      does not know, who cannot comprehend what such men as M. d&rsquo;Herblay, M. du
      Vallon, and myself are. Taken or killed! Ah! Ah! sire! tell me, if the
      news is true, how much has it cost you in men and money. We will then
      reckon if the game has been worth the stakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke thus, the king went up to him in great anger, and said,
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, your replies are those of a rebel! Tell me, if you
      please, who is king of France? Do you know any other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the captain of the musketeers, coldly, &ldquo;I very well
      remember that one morning at Vaux you addressed that question to many
      people who did not answer to it, whilst I, on my part, did answer to it.
      If I recognized my king on that day, when the thing was not easy, I think
      it would be useless to ask the question of me now, when your majesty and I
      are alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Louis cast down his eyes. It appeared to him that the shade
      of the unfortunate Philippe passed between D&rsquo;Artagnan and himself, to
      evoke the remembrance of that terrible adventure. Almost at the same
      moment an officer entered and placed a dispatch in the hands of the king,
      who, in his turn, changed color, while reading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what I learn here you would know later; it is better
      I should tell you, and that you should learn it from the mouth of your
      king. A battle has taken place at Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a calm air, though his heart was
      beating fast enough to choke him. &ldquo;Well, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur&mdash;and I have lost a hundred and ten men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A beam of joy and pride shone in the eyes of D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;And the rebels?&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rebels have fled,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan could not restrain a cry of triumph. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; added the king, &ldquo;I
      have a fleet which closely blockades Belle-Isle, and I am certain not a
      bark can escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; said the musketeer, brought back to his dismal idea, &ldquo;if these
      two gentlemen are taken&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be hanged,&rdquo; said the king, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do they know it?&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, repressing his trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know it, because you must have told them yourself; and all the
      country knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sire, they will never be taken alive, I will answer for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the king, negligently, and taking up his letter again. &ldquo;Very
      well, they will be dead, then, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, and that will come to
      the same thing, since I should only take them to have them hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan wiped the sweat which flowed from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; pursued Louis XIV., &ldquo;that I would one day be an
      affectionate, generous, and constant master. You are now the only man of
      former times worthy of my anger or my friendship. I will not spare you
      either sentiment, according to your conduct. Could you serve a king,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, who should have a hundred kings, his equals, in the
      kingdom? Could I, tell me, do with such weak instruments the great things
      I meditate? Did you ever see an artist effect great works with an unworthy
      tool? Far from us, monsieur, the old leaven of feudal abuse! The Fronde,
      which threatened to ruin monarchy, has emancipated it. I am master at
      home, Captain d&rsquo;Artagnan, and I shall have servants who, lacking, perhaps,
      your genius, will carry devotion and obedience to the verge of heroism. Of
      what consequence, I ask you, of what consequence is it that God has given
      no sense to arms and legs? It is to the head he has given genius, and the
      head, you know, the rest obey. I am the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan started. Louis XIV. continued as if he had seen nothing,
      although this emotion had not by any means escaped him. &ldquo;Now, let us
      conclude between us two the bargain I promised to make with you one day
      when you found me in a very strange predicament at Blois. Do me justice,
      monsieur, when you admit I do not make any one pay for the tears of shame
      that I then shed. Look around you; lofty heads have bowed. Bow yours, or
      choose such exile as will suit you. Perhaps, when reflecting upon it, you
      will find your king has a generous heart, who reckons sufficiently upon
      your loyalty to allow you to leave him dissatisfied, when you possess a
      great state secret. You are a brave man; I know you to be so. Why have you
      judged me prematurely? Judge me from this day forward, D&rsquo;Artagnan, and be
      as severe as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan remained bewildered, mute, undecided for the first time in his
      life. At last he had found an adversary worthy of him. This was no longer
      trick, it was calculation; no longer violence, but strength; no longer
      passion, but will; no longer boasting, but council. This young man who had
      brought down a Fouquet, and could do without a D&rsquo;Artagnan, deranged the
      somewhat headstrong calculations of the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us see what stops you?&rdquo; said the king, kindly. &ldquo;You have given
      in your resignation; shall I refuse to accept it? I admit that it may be
      hard for such an old captain to recover lost good-humor.&rdquo;
     </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a melancholy tone, &ldquo;that is not my most
serious care. I hesitate to take back my resignation because I am old in
comparison with you, and have habits difficult to abandon. Henceforward,
you must have courtiers who know how to amuse you&mdash;madmen who will get
themselves killed to carry out what you call your great works. Great
they will be, I feel&mdash;but, if by chance I should not think them so?
I have seen war, sire, I have seen peace; I have served Richelieu and
Mazarin; I have been scorched with your father, at the fire of Rochelle;
riddled with sword-thrusts like a sieve, having grown a new skin ten
times, as serpents do. After affronts and injustices, I have a command
which was formerly something, because it gave the bearer the right of
speaking as he liked to his king. But your captain of the musketeers
will henceforward be an officer guarding the outer doors. Truly, sire,
if that is to be my employment from this time, seize the opportunity of
our being on good terms, to take it from me. Do not imagine that I bear
malice; no, you have tamed me, as you say; but it must be confessed that
in taming me you have lowered me; by bowing me you have convicted me of
weakness. If you knew how well it suits me to carry my head high,
and what a pitiful mien I shall have while scenting the dust of your
carpets! Oh! sire, I regret sincerely, and you will regret as I do, the
old days when the king of France saw in every vestibule those insolent
gentlemen, lean, always swearing&mdash;cross-grained mastiffs, who could bite
mortally in the hour of danger or of battle. These men were the best of
courtiers to the hand which fed them&mdash;they would lick it; but for the
hand that struck them, oh! the bite that followed! A little gold on the
lace of their cloaks, a slender stomach in their <i>hauts-de-chausses</i>,
a little sparkling of gray in their dry hair, and you will behold the
handsome dukes and peers, the haughty <i>marechaux</i> of France. But why
should I tell you all this? The king is master; he wills that I
should make verses, he wills that I should polish the mosaics of his
ante-chambers with satin shoes. <i>Mordioux!</i> that is difficult, but I
have got over greater difficulties. I will do it. Why should I do it?
Because I love money?&mdash;I have enough. Because I am ambitious?&mdash;my career
is almost at an end. Because I love the court? No. I will remain here
because I have been accustomed for thirty years to go and take the
orderly word of the king, and to have said to me &lsquo;Good evening,
D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rsquo; with a smile I did not beg for. That smile I will beg for!
Are you content, sire?&rdquo; And D&rsquo;Artagnan bowed his silver head, upon which
the smiling king placed his white hand with pride.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;Thanks, my old servant, my faithful friend,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;As, reckoning
from this day, I have no longer any enemies in France, it remains with
me to send you to a foreign field to gather your marshal&rsquo;s baton. Depend
upon me for finding you an opportunity. In the meanwhile, eat of my very
best bread, and sleep in absolute tranquillity.&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all kind and well!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, much agitated. &ldquo;But those
      poor men at Belle-Isle? One of them, in particular&mdash;so good! so
      brave! so true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ask their pardon of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my knees, sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! then, go and take it to them, if it be still in time. But do you
      answer for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my life, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, then. To-morrow I set out for Paris. Return by that time, for I do
      not wish you to leave me in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured of that, sire,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, kissing the royal hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a heart swelling with joy, he rushed out of the castle on his way
      to Belle-Isle.

    <h2>
      Chapter LIV. M. Fouquet&rsquo;s Friends.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king had returned to Paris, and with him D&rsquo;Artagnan, who, in
      twenty-four hours, having made with greatest care all possible inquiries
      at Belle-Isle, succeeded in learning nothing of the secret so well kept by
      the heavy rock of Locmaria, which had fallen on the heroic Porthos. The
      captain of the musketeers only knew what those two valiant men&mdash;these
      two friends, whose defense he had so nobly taken up, whose lives he had so
      earnestly endeavored to save&mdash;aided by three faithful Bretons, had
      accomplished against a whole army. He had seen, spread on the neighboring
      heath, the human remains which had stained with clouted blood the
      scattered stones among the flowering broom. He learned also that a bark
      had been seen far out at sea, and that, like a bird of prey, a royal
      vessel had pursued, overtaken, and devoured the poor little bird that was
      flying with such palpitating wings. But there D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s certainties
      ended. The field of supposition was thrown open. Now, what could he
      conjecture? The vessel had not returned. It is true that a brisk wind had
      prevailed for three days; but the corvette was known to be a good sailer
      and solid in its timbers; it had no need to fear a gale of wind, and it
      ought, according to the calculation of D&rsquo;Artagnan, to have either returned
      to Brest, or come back to the mouth of the Loire. Such was the news,
      ambiguous, it is true, but in some degree reassuring to him personally,
      which D&rsquo;Artagnan brought to Louis XIV., when the king, followed by all the
      court, returned to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis, satisfied with his success&mdash;Louis, more mild and affable as he
      felt himself more powerful&mdash;had not ceased for an instant to ride
      beside the carriage door of Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Everybody was
      anxious to amuse the two queens, so as to make them forget this
      abandonment by son and husband. Everything breathed the future, the past
      was nothing to anybody. Only that past was like a painful bleeding wound
      to the hearts of certain tender and devoted spirits. Scarcely was the king
      reinstalled in Paris, when he received a touching proof of this. Louis
      XIV. had just risen and taken his first repast when his captain of the
      musketeers presented himself before him. D&rsquo;Artagnan was pale and looked
      unhappy. The king, at the first glance, perceived the change in a
      countenance generally so unconcerned. &ldquo;What is the matter, D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, a great misfortune has happened to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I have lost one of my friends, M. du Vallon, in the affair of
      Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, while speaking these words, D&rsquo;Artagnan fixed his falcon eye upon
      Louis XIV., to catch the first feeling that would show itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; replied the king, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it, and did not tell me!&rdquo; cried the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what good? Your grief, my friend, was so well worthy of respect. It
      was my duty to treat it gently. To have informed you of this misfortune,
      which I knew would pain you so greatly, D&rsquo;Artagnan, would have been, in
      your eyes, to have triumphed over you. Yes, I knew that M. du Vallon had
      buried himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria; I knew that M. d&rsquo;Herblay had
      taken one of my vessels with its crew, and had compelled it to convey him
      to Bayonne. But I was willing you should learn these matters in a direct
      manner, in order that you might be convinced my friends are with me
      respected and sacred; that always in me the man will sacrifice himself to
      subjects, whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice men to majesty
      and power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sire, how could you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you yourself know, D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this letter, sire, which M. d&rsquo;Herblay, free and out of danger, writes
      me from Bayonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the king, drawing from a casket placed upon the table
      closet to the seat upon which D&rsquo;Artagnan was leaning, &ldquo;here is a letter
      copied exactly from that of M. d&rsquo;Herblay. Here is the very letter, which
      Colbert placed in my hands a week before you received yours. I am well
      served, you may perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; murmured the musketeer, &ldquo;you were the only man whose star was
      equal to the task of dominating the fortune and strength of my two
      friends. You have used your power, sire, you will not abuse it, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the king, with a smile beaming with kindness, &ldquo;I could
      have M. d&rsquo;Herblay carried off from the territories of the king of Spain,
      and brought here, alive, to inflict justice upon him. But, D&rsquo;Artagnan, be
      assured I will not yield to this first and natural impulse. He is free&mdash;let
      him continue free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire! you will not always remain so clement, so noble, so generous as
      you have shown yourself with respect to me and M. d&rsquo;Herblay; you will have
      about you counselors who will cure you of that weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, D&rsquo;Artagnan, you are mistaken when you accuse my council of urging me
      to pursue rigorous measures. The advice to spare M. d&rsquo;Herblay comes from
      Colbert himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, extremely surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; continued the king, with a kindness very uncommon to him, &ldquo;I
      have several pieces of good news to announce to you; but you shall know
      them, my dear captain, the moment I have made my accounts all straight. I
      have said that I wish to make, and would make, your fortune; that promise
      will soon become reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand times thanks, sire! I can wait. But I implore you, whilst I go
      and practice patience, that your majesty will deign to notice those poor
      people who have for so long a time besieged your ante-chamber, and come
      humbly to lay a petition at your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enemies of your majesty.&rdquo; The king raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends of M. Fouquet,&rdquo; added D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Gourville, M. Pelisson, and a poet, M. Jean de la Fontaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king took a moment to reflect. &ldquo;What do they want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do they appear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In great affliction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them come in,&rdquo; said the king, with a serious brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan turned rapidly on his heel, raised the tapestry which closed
      the entrance to the royal chamber, and directing his voice to the
      adjoining room, cried, &ldquo;Enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three men D&rsquo;Artagnan had named immediately appeared at the door of the
      cabinet in which were the king and his captain. A profound silence
      prevailed in their passage. The courtiers, at the approach of the friends
      of the unfortunate superintendent of finances, drew back, as if fearful of
      being affected by contagion with disgrace and misfortune. D&rsquo;Artagnan, with
      a quick step, came forward to take by the hand the unhappy men who stood
      trembling at the door of the cabinet; he led them in front of the king&rsquo;s
      <i>fauteuil</i>, who, having placed himself in the embrasure of a window,
      awaited the moment of presentation, and was preparing himself to give the
      supplicants a rigorously diplomatic reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the friends of Fouquet&rsquo;s to advance was Pelisson. He did not
      weep, but his tears were only restrained that the king might better hear
      his voice and prayer. Gourville bit his lips to check his tears, out of
      respect for the king. La Fontaine buried his face in his handkerchief, and
      the only signs of life he gave were the convulsive motions of his
      shoulders, raised by his sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king preserved his dignity. His countenance was impassible. He even
      maintained the frown which appeared when D&rsquo;Artagnan announced his enemies.
      He made a gesture which signified, &ldquo;Speak;&rdquo; and he remained standing, with
      his eyes fixed searchingly on these desponding men. Pelisson bowed to the
      ground, and La Fontaine knelt as people do in churches. This dismal
      silence, disturbed only by sighs and groans, began to excite in the king,
      not compassion, but impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Pelisson,&rdquo; said he, in a sharp, dry tone. &ldquo;Monsieur Gourville,
      and you, Monsieur&mdash;&rdquo; and he did not name La Fontaine, &ldquo;I cannot,
      without sensible displeasure, see you come to plead for one of the
      greatest criminals it is the duty of justice to punish. A king does not
      allow himself to soften save at the tears of the innocent, the remorse of
      the guilty. I have no faith either in the remorse of M. Fouquet or the
      tears of his friends, because the one is tainted to the very heart, and
      the others ought to dread offending me in my own palace. For these
      reasons, I beg you, Monsieur Pelisson, Monsieur Gourville, and you,
      Monsieur&mdash;, to say nothing that will not plainly proclaim the respect
      you have for my will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Pelisson, trembling at these words, &ldquo;we are come to say
      nothing to your majesty that is not the most profound expression of the
      most sincere respect and love that are due to a king from all his
      subjects. Your majesty&rsquo;s justice is redoubtable; every one must yield to
      the sentences it pronounces. We respectfully bow before it. Far from us
      the idea of coming to defend him who has had the misfortune to offend your
      majesty. He who has incurred your displeasure may be a friend of ours, but
      he is an enemy to the state. We abandon him, but with tears, to the
      severity of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; interrupted the king, calmed by that supplicating voice, and
      those persuasive words, &ldquo;my parliament will decide. I do not strike
      without first having weighed the crime; my justice does not wield the
      sword without employing first a pair of scales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore we have every confidence in that impartiality of the king, and
      hope to make our feeble voices heard, with the consent of your majesty,
      when the hour for defending an accused friend strikes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, messieurs, what do you ask of me?&rdquo; said the king, with his
      most imposing air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; continued Pelisson, &ldquo;the accused has a wife and family. The little
      property he had was scarcely sufficient to pay his debts, and Madame
      Fouquet, since her husband&rsquo;s captivity, is abandoned by everybody. The
      hand of your majesty strikes like the hand of God. When the Lord sends the
      curse of leprosy or pestilence into a family, every one flies and shuns
      the abode of the leprous or plague-stricken. Sometimes, but very rarely, a
      generous physician alone ventures to approach the ill-reputed threshold,
      passes it with courage, and risks his life to combat death. He is the last
      resource of the dying, the chosen instrument of heavenly mercy. Sire, we
      supplicate you, with clasped hands and bended knees, as a divinity is
      supplicated! Madame Fouquet has no longer any friends, no longer any means
      of support; she weeps in her deserted home, abandoned by all those who
      besieged its doors in the hour of prosperity; she has neither credit nor
      hope left. At least, the unhappy wretch upon whom your anger falls
      receives from you, however culpable he may be, his daily bread though
      moistened by his tears. As much afflicted, more destitute than her
      husband, Madame Fouquet&mdash;the lady who had the honor to receive your
      majesty at her table&mdash;Madame Fouquet, the wife of the ancient
      superintendent of your majesty&rsquo;s finances, Madame Fouquet has no longer
      bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the mortal silence which had chained the breath of Pelisson&rsquo;s two
      friends was broken by an outburst of sobs; and D&rsquo;Artagnan, whose chest
      heaved at hearing this humble prayer, turned round towards the angle of
      the cabinet to bite his mustache and conceal a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king had preserved his eye dry and his countenance severe; but the
      blood had mounted to his cheeks, and the firmness of his look was visibly
      diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; said he, in an agitated voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We come humbly to ask your majesty,&rdquo; replied Pelisson, upon whom emotion
      was fast gaining, &ldquo;to permit us, without incurring the displeasure of your
      majesty, to lend to Madame Fouquet two thousand pistoles collected among
      the old friends of her husband, in order that the widow may not stand in
      need of the necessaries of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word <i>widow</i>, pronounced by Pelisson whilst Fouquet was still
      alive, the king turned very pale;&mdash;his pride disappeared; pity rose
      from his heart to his lips; he cast a softened look upon the men who knelt
      sobbing at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I should confound the innocent with the
      guilty. They know me but ill who doubt my mercy towards the weak. I strike
      none but the arrogant. Do, messieurs, do all that your hearts counsel you
      to assuage the grief of Madame Fouquet. Go, messieurs&mdash;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three now rose in silence with dry eyes. The tears had been scorched
      away by contact with their burning cheeks and eyelids. They had not the
      strength to address their thanks to the king, who himself cut short their
      solemn reverences by entrenching himself suddenly behind the <i>fauteuil</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan remained alone with the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, approaching the young prince, who interrogated him with
      his look. &ldquo;Well, my master! If you had not the device which belongs to
      your sun, I would recommend you one which M. Conrart might translate into
      eclectic Latin, &lsquo;Calm with the lowly; stormy with the strong.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled, and passed into the next apartment, after having said to
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I give you the leave of absence you must want to put the
      affairs of your friend, the late M. du Vallon, in order.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter LV. Porthos&rsquo;s Will.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Pierrefonds everything was in mourning. The courts were deserted&mdash;the
      stables closed&mdash;the parterres neglected. In the basins, the
      fountains, formerly so jubilantly fresh and noisy, had stopped of
      themselves. Along the roads around the chateau came a few grave personages
      mounted on mules or country nags. These were rural neighbors, cures and
      bailiffs of adjacent estates. All these people entered the chateau
      silently, handed their horses to a melancholy-looking groom, and directed
      their steps, conducted by a huntsman in black, to the great dining-room,
      where Mousqueton received them at the door. Mousqueton had become so thin
      in two days that his clothes moved upon him like an ill-fitting scabbard
      in which the sword-blade dances at each motion. His face, composed of red
      and white, like that of the Madonna of Vandyke, was furrowed by two silver
      rivulets which had dug their beds in his cheeks, as full formerly as they
      had become flabby since his grief began. At each fresh arrival, Mousqueton
      found fresh tears, and it was pitiful to see him press his throat with his
      fat hand to keep from bursting into sobs and lamentations. All these
      visits were for the purpose of hearing the reading of Porthos&rsquo;s will,
      announced for that day, and at which all the covetous friends of the dead
      man were anxious to be present, as he had left no relations behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors took their places as they arrived, and the great room had
      just been closed when the clock struck twelve, the hour fixed for the
      reading of the important document. Porthos&rsquo;s procureur&mdash;and that was
      naturally the successor of Master Coquenard&mdash;commenced by slowly
      unfolding the vast parchment upon which the powerful hand of Porthos had
      traced his sovereign will. The seal broken&mdash;the spectacles put on&mdash;the
      preliminary cough having sounded&mdash;every one pricked up his ears.
      Mousqueton had squatted himself in a corner, the better to weep and the
      better to hear. All at once the folding-doors of the great room, which had
      been shut, were thrown open as if by magic, and a warlike figure appeared
      upon the threshold, resplendent in the full light of the sun. This was
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, who had come alone to the gate, and finding nobody to hold his
      stirrup, had tied his horse to the knocker and announced himself. The
      splendor of daylight invading the room, the murmur of all present, and,
      more than all, the instinct of the faithful dog, drew Mousqueton from his
      reverie; he raised his head, recognized the old friend of his master, and,
      screaming with grief, he embraced his knees, watering the floor with his
      tears. D&rsquo;Artagnan raised the poor intendant, embraced him as if he had
      been a brother, and, having nobly saluted the assembly, who all bowed as
      they whispered to each other his name, he went and took his seat at the
      extremity of the great carved oak hall, still holding by the hand poor
      Mousqueton, who was suffocating with excess of woe, and sank upon the
      steps. Then the procureur, who, like the rest, was considerably agitated,
      commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, after a profession of faith of the most Christian character,
      asked pardon of his enemies for all the injuries he might have done them.
      At this paragraph, a ray of inexpressible pride beamed from the eyes of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled to his mind the old soldier; all those enemies of Porthos
      brought to earth by his valiant hand; he reckoned up the numbers of them,
      and said to himself that Porthos had acted wisely, not to enumerate his
      enemies or the injuries done to them, or the task would have been too much
      for the reader. Then came the following schedule of his extensive lands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I possess at this present time, by the grace of God&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1. The domain of Pierrefonds, lands, woods, meadows, waters, and forests,
      surrounded by good walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2. The domain of Bracieux, chateaux, forests, plowed lands, forming three
      farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;3. The little estate Du Vallon, so named because it is in the valley.&rdquo;
       (Brave Porthos!)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;4. Fifty farms in Touraine, amounting to five hundred acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;5. Three mills upon the Cher, bringing in six hundred livres each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;6. Three fish-pools in Berry, producing two hundred livres a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to my personal or movable property, so called because it can be moved,
      as is so well explained by my learned friend the bishop of Vannes&mdash;&rdquo;
       (D&rsquo;Artagnan shuddered at the dismal remembrance attached to that name)&mdash;the
      procureur continued imperturbably&mdash;&ldquo;they consist&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1. In goods which I cannot detail here for want of room, and which
      furnish all my chateaux or houses, but of which the list is drawn up by my
      intendant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one turned his eyes towards Mousqueton, who was still lost in grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2. In twenty horses for saddle and draught, which I have particularly at
      my chateau of Pierrefonds, and which are called&mdash;Bayard, Roland,
      Charlemagne, Pepin, Dunois, La Hire, Ogier, Samson, Milo, Nimrod, Urganda,
      Armida, Flastrade, Dalilah, Rebecca, Yolande, Finette, Grisette, Lisette,
      and Musette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;3. In sixty dogs, forming six packs, divided as follows: the first, for
      the stag; the second, for the wolf; the third, for the wild boar; the
      fourth, for the hare; and the two others, for setters and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;4. In arms for war and the chase contained in my gallery of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;5. My wines of Anjou, selected for Athos, who liked them formerly; my
      wines of Burgundy, Champagne, Bordeaux, and Spain, stocking eight cellars
      and twelve vaults, in my various houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;6. My pictures and statues, which are said to be of great value, and
      which are sufficiently numerous to fatigue the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;7. My library, consisting of six thousand volumes, quite new, and have
      never been opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;8. My silver plate, which is perhaps a little worn, but which ought to
      weigh from a thousand to twelve hundred pounds, for I had great trouble in
      lifting the coffer that contained it and could not carry it more than six
      times round my chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;9. All these objects, in addition to the table and house linen, are
      divided in the residences I liked the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the reader stopped to take breath. Every one sighed, coughed, and
      redoubled his attention. The procureur resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived without having any children, and it is probable I never
      shall have any, which to me is a cutting grief. And yet I am mistaken, for
      I have a son, in common with my other friends; that is, M. Raoul Auguste
      Jules de Bragelonne, the true son of M. le Comte de la Fere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young nobleman appears to me extremely worthy to succeed the valiant
      gentleman of whom I am the friend and very humble servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a sharp sound interrupted the reader. It was D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s sword,
      which, slipping from his baldric, had fallen on the sonorous flooring.
      Every one turned his eyes that way, and saw that a large tear had rolled
      from the thick lid of D&rsquo;Artagnan, half-way down to his aquiline nose, the
      luminous edge of which shone like a little crescent moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is why,&rdquo; continued the procureur, &ldquo;I have left all my property,
      movable, or immovable, comprised in the above enumerations, to M. le
      Vicomte Raoul Auguste Jules de Bragelonne, son of M. le Comte de la Fere,
      to console him for the grief he seems to suffer, and enable him to add
      more luster to his already glorious name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vague murmur ran through the auditory. The procureur continued, seconded
      by the flashing eye of D&rsquo;Artagnan, which, glancing over the assembly,
      quickly restored the interrupted silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On condition that M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do give to M. le Chevalier
      d&rsquo;Artagnan, captain of the king&rsquo;s musketeers, whatever the said Chevalier
      d&rsquo;Artagnan may demand of my property. On condition that M. le Vicomte de
      Bragelonne do pay a good pension to M. le Chevalier d&rsquo;Herblay, my friend,
      if he should need it in exile. I leave to my intendant Mousqueton all of
      my clothes, of city, war, or chase, to the number of forty-seven suits, in
      the assurance that he will wear them till they are worn out, for the love
      of and in remembrance of his master. Moreover, I bequeath to M. le Vicomte
      de Bragelonne my old servant and faithful friend Mousqueton, already
      named, providing that the said vicomte shall so act that Mousqueton shall
      declare, when dying, he has never ceased to be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these words, Mousqueton bowed, pale and trembling; his
      shoulders shook convulsively; his countenance, compressed by a frightful
      grief, appeared from between his icy hands, and the spectators saw him
      stagger and hesitate, as if, though wishing to leave the hall, he did not
      know the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mousqueton, my good friend,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;go and make your
      preparations. I will take you with me to Athos&rsquo;s house, whither I shall go
      on leaving Pierrefonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mousqueton made no reply. He scarcely breathed, as if everything in that
      hall would from that time be foreign. He opened the door, and slowly
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procureur finished his reading, after which the greater part of those
      who had come to hear the last will of Porthos dispersed by degrees, many
      disappointed, but all penetrated with respect. As for D&rsquo;Artagnan, thus
      left alone, after having received the formal compliments of the procureur,
      he was lost in admiration of the wisdom of the testator, who had so
      judiciously bestowed his wealth upon the most necessitous and the most
      worthy, with a delicacy that neither nobleman nor courtier could have
      displayed more kindly. When Porthos enjoined Raoul de Bragelonne to give
      D&rsquo;Artagnan all that he would ask, he knew well, our worthy Porthos, that
      D&rsquo;Artagnan would ask or take nothing; and in case he did demand anything,
      none but himself could say what. Porthos left a pension to Aramis, who, if
      he should be inclined to ask too much, was checked by the example of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan; and that word <i>exile</i>, thrown out by the testator,
      without apparent intention, was it not the mildest, most exquisite
      criticism upon that conduct of Aramis which had brought about the death of
      Porthos? But there was no mention of Athos in the testament of the dead.
      Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the
      best part to the father? The rough mind of Porthos had fathomed all these
      causes, seized all these shades more clearly than law, better than custom,
      with more propriety than taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos had indeed a heart,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan to himself with a sigh. As
      he made this reflection, he fancied he hard a groan in the room above him;
      and he thought immediately of poor Mousqueton, whom he felt it was a
      pleasing duty to divert from his grief. For this purpose he left the hall
      hastily to seek the worthy intendant, as he had not returned. He ascended
      the staircase leading to the first story, and perceived, in Porthos&rsquo;s own
      chamber, a heap of clothes of all colors and materials, upon which
      Mousqueton had laid himself down after heaping them all on the floor
      together. It was the legacy of the faithful friend. Those clothes were
      truly his own; they had been given to him; the hand of Mousqueton was
      stretched over these relics, which he was kissing with his lips, with all
      his face, and covered with his body. D&rsquo;Artagnan approached to console the
      poor fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he does not stir&mdash;he has fainted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But D&rsquo;Artagnan was mistaken. Mousqueton was dead! Dead, like the dog who,
      having lost his master, crawls back to die upon his cloak.

    <h2>
      Chapter LVI. The Old Age of Athos.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While these affairs were separating forever the four musketeers, formerly
      bound together in a manner that seemed indissoluble, Athos, left alone
      after the departure of Raoul, began to pay his tribute to that foretaste
      of death which is called the absence of those we love. Back in his house
      at Blois, no longer having even Grimaud to receive a poor smile as he
      passed through the parterre, Athos daily felt the decline of vigor of a
      nature which for so long a time had seemed impregnable. Age, which had
      been kept back by the presence of the beloved object, arrived with that <i>cortege</i>
      of pains and inconveniences, which grows by geometrical accretion. Athos
      had no longer his son to induce him to walk firmly, with head erect, as a
      good example; he had no longer, in those brilliant eyes of the young man,
      an ever-ardent focus at which to kindle anew the fire of his looks. And
      then, must it be said, that nature, exquisite in tenderness and reserve,
      no longer finding anything to understand its feelings, gave itself up to
      grief with all the warmth of common natures when they yield to joy. The
      Comte de la Fere, who had remained a young man to his sixty-second year;
      the warrior who had preserved his strength in spite of fatigue; his
      freshness of mind in spite of misfortune, his mild serenity of soul and
      body in spite of Milady, in spite of Mazarin, in spite of La Valliere;
      Athos had become an old man in a week, from the moment at which he lost
      the comfort of his later youth. Still handsome, though bent, noble, but
      sad, he sought, since his solitude, the deeper glades where sunshine
      scarcely penetrated. He discontinued all the mighty exercises he had
      enjoyed through life, when Raoul was no longer with him. The servants,
      accustomed to see him stirring with the dawn at all seasons, were
      astonished to hear seven o&rsquo;clock strike before their master quitted his
      bed. Athos remained in bed with a book under his pillow&mdash;but he did
      not sleep, neither did he read. Remaining in bed that he might no longer
      have to carry his body, he allowed his soul and spirit to wander from
      their envelope and return to his son, or to God. <a href="#linknote-6"
       name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      His people were sometimes terrified to see him, for hours together,
      absorbed in silent reverie, mute and insensible; he no longer heard the
      timid step of the servant who came to the door of his chamber to watch the
      sleeping or waking of his master. It often occurred that he forgot the day
      had half passed away, that the hours for the two first meals were gone by.
      Then he was awakened. He rose, descended to his shady walk, then came out
      a little into the sun, as though to partake of its warmth for a minute in
      memory of his absent child. And then the dismal monotonous walk
      recommenced, until, exhausted, he regained the chamber and his bed, his
      domicile by choice. For several days the comte did not speak a single
      word. He refused to receive the visits that were paid him, and during the
      night he was seen to relight his lamp and pass long hours in writing, or
      examining parchments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos wrote one of these letters to Vannes, another to Fontainebleau; they
      remained without answers. We know why: Aramis had quitted France, and
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was traveling from Nantes to Paris, from Paris to Pierrefonds.
      His <i>valet de chambre</i> observed that he shortened his walk every day
      by several turns. The great alley of limes soon became too long for feet
      that used to traverse it formerly a hundred times a day. The comte walked
      feebly as far as the middle trees, seated himself upon a mossy bank that
      sloped towards a sidewalk, and there waited the return of his strength, or
      rather the return of night. Very shortly a hundred steps exhausted him. At
      length Athos refused to rise at all; he declined all nourishment, and his
      terrified people, although he did not complain, although he wore a smile
      upon his lips, although he continued to speak with his sweet voice&mdash;his
      people went to Blois in search of the ancient physician of the late
      Monsieur, and brought him to the Comte de la Fere in such a fashion that
      he could see the comte without being himself seen. For this purpose, they
      placed him in a closet adjoining the chamber of the patient, and implored
      him not to show himself, for fear of displeasing their master, who had not
      asked for a physician. The doctor obeyed. Athos was a sort of model for
      the gentlemen of the country; the Blaisois boasted of possessing this
      sacred relic of French glory. Athos was a great seigneur compared with
      such nobles as the king improvised by touching with his artificial scepter
      the patched-up trunks of the heraldic trees of the province.
    </p>
    <p>
      People respected Athos, we say, and they loved him. The physician could
      not bear to see his people weep, to see flock round him the poor of the
      canton, to whom Athos had so often given life and consolation by his kind
      words and his charities. He examined, therefore, from the depths of his
      hiding-place, the nature of that mysterious malady which bent and aged
      more mortally every day a man but lately so full of life and a desire to
      live. He remarked upon the cheeks of Athos the hectic hue of fever, which
      feeds upon itself; slow fever, pitiless, born in a fold of the heart,
      sheltering itself behind that rampart, growing from the suffering it
      engenders, at once cause and effect of a perilous situation. The comte
      spoke to nobody; he did not even talk to himself. His thought feared
      noise; it approached to that degree of over-excitement which borders upon
      ecstasy. Man thus absorbed, though he does not yet belong to God, already
      appertains no longer to the earth. The doctor remained for several hours
      studying this painful struggle of the will against superior power; he was
      terrified at seeing those eyes always fixed, ever directed on some
      invisible object; was terrified at the monotonous beating of that heart
      from which never a sigh arose to vary the melancholy state; for often pain
      becomes the hope of the physician. Half a day passed away thus. The doctor
      formed his resolution like a brave man; he issued suddenly from his place
      of retreat, and went straight up to Athos, who beheld him without evincing
      more surprise than if he had understood nothing of the apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le comte, I crave your pardon,&rdquo; said the doctor, coming up to
      the patient with open arms; &ldquo;but I have a reproach to make you&mdash;you
      shall hear me.&rdquo; And he seated himself by the pillow of Athos, who had
      great trouble in rousing himself from his preoccupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, doctor?&rdquo; asked the comte, after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is, you are ill, monsieur, and have had no advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! ill!&rdquo; said Athos, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fever, consumption, weakness, decay, monsieur le comte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weakness!&rdquo; replied Athos; &ldquo;is it possible? I do not get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! monsieur le comte, no subterfuges; you are a good Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your wish to kill yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! monsieur, you are in a fair way of doing so. Thus to remain is
      suicide. Get well! monsieur le comte, get well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what? Find the disease first. For my part, I never knew myself better;
      never did the sky appear more blue to me; never did I take more care of my
      flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a hidden grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Concealed!&mdash;not at all; the absence of my son, doctor; that is my
      malady, and I do not conceal it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le comte, your son lives, he is strong, he has all the future
      before him&mdash;the future of men of merit, of his race; live for him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do live, doctor; oh! be satisfied of that,&rdquo; added he, with a
      melancholy smile; &ldquo;for as long as Raoul lives, it will be plainly known,
      for as long as he lives, I shall live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very simple thing. At this moment, doctor, I leave life suspended
      within me. A forgetful, dissipated, indifferent life would be beyond my
      strength, now I have no longer Raoul with me. You do not ask the lamp to
      burn when the match has not illumed the flame; do not ask me to live
      amidst noise and merriment. I vegetate, I prepare myself, I wait. Look,
      doctor; remember those soldiers we have so often seen together at the
      ports, where they were waiting to embark; lying down, indifferent, half on
      one element, half on the other; they were neither at the place where the
      sea was going to carry them, nor at the place the earth was going to lose
      them; baggage prepared, minds on the stretch, arms stacked&mdash;they
      waited. I repeat it, the word is the one which paints my present life.
      Lying down like the soldiers, my ear on the stretch for the report that
      may reach me, I wish to be ready to set out at the first summons. Who will
      make me that summons? life or death? God or Raoul? My baggage is packed,
      my soul is prepared, I await the signal&mdash;I wait, doctor, I wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor knew the temper of that mind; he appreciated the strength of
      that body; he reflected for the moment, told himself that words were
      useless, remedies absurd, and left the chateau, exhorting Athos&rsquo;s servants
      not to quit him for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor being gone, Athos evinced neither anger nor vexation at having
      been disturbed. He did not even desire that all letters that came should
      be brought to him directly. He knew very well that every distraction which
      should arise would be a joy, a hope, which his servants would have paid
      with their blood to procure him. Sleep had become rare. By intense
      thinking, Athos forgot himself, for a few hours at most, in a reverie most
      profound, more obscure than other people would have called a dream. The
      momentary repose which this forgetfulness thus gave the body, still
      further fatigued the soul, for Athos lived a double life during these
      wanderings of his understanding. One night, he dreamt that Raoul was
      dressing himself in a tent, to go upon an expedition commanded by M. de
      Beaufort in person. The young man was sad; he clasped his cuirass slowly,
      and slowly he girded on his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked his father, tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What afflicts me is the death of Porthos, ever so dear a friend,&rdquo; replied
      Raoul. &ldquo;I suffer here the grief you soon will feel at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the vision disappeared with the slumber of Athos. At daybreak one of
      his servants entered his master&rsquo;s apartment, and gave him a letter which
      came from Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The writing of Aramis,&rdquo; thought the comte; and he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos is dead!&rdquo; cried he, after the first lines. &ldquo;Oh! Raoul, Raoul!
      thanks! thou keepest thy promise, thou warnest me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Athos, seized with a mortal sweat, fainted in his bed, without any
      other cause than weakness.

    <h2>
      Chapter LVII. Athos&rsquo;s Vision.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When this fainting of Athos had ceased, the comte, almost ashamed of
      having given way before this superior natural event, dressed himself and
      ordered his horse, determined to ride to Blois, to open more certain
      correspondences with either Africa, D&rsquo;Artagnan, or Aramis. In fact, this
      letter from Aramis informed the Comte de la Fere of the bad success of the
      expedition of Belle-Isle. It gave him sufficient details of the death of
      Porthos to move the tender and devoted heart of Athos to its innermost
      fibers. Athos wished to go and pay his friend Porthos a last visit. To
      render this honor to his companion in arms, he meant to send to
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, to prevail upon him to recommence the painful voyage to
      Belle-Isle, to accomplish in his company that sad pilgrimage to the tomb
      of the giant he had so much loved, then to return to his dwelling to obey
      that secret influence which was conducting him to eternity by a mysterious
      road. But scarcely had his joyous servants dressed their master, whom they
      saw with pleasure preparing for a journey which might dissipate his
      melancholy; scarcely had the comte&rsquo;s gentlest horse been saddled and
      brought to the door, when the father of Raoul felt his head become
      confused, his legs give way, and he clearly perceived the impossibility of
      going one step further. He ordered himself to be carried into the sun;
      they laid him upon his bed of moss where he passed a full hour before he
      could recover his spirits. Nothing could be more natural than this
      weakness after then inert repose of the latter days. Athos took a <i>bouillon</i>,
      to give him strength, and bathed his dried lips in a glassful of the wine
      he loved the best&mdash;that old Anjou wine mentioned by Porthos in his
      admirable will. Then, refreshed, free in mind, he had his horse brought
      again; but only with the aid of his servants was he able painfully to
      climb into the saddle. He did not go a hundred paces; a shivering seized
      him again at the turning of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very strange!&rdquo; said he to his <i>valet de chambre</i>, who
      accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us stop, monsieur&mdash;I conjure you!&rdquo; replied the faithful servant;
      &ldquo;how pale you are getting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not prevent my pursuing my route, now I have once started,&rdquo;
       replied the comte. And he gave his horse his head again. But suddenly, the
      animal, instead of obeying the thought of his master, stopped. A movement,
      of which Athos was unconscious, had checked the bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;wills that I should go no further. Support me,&rdquo;
       added he, stretching out his arms; &ldquo;quick! come closer! I feel my muscles
      relax&mdash;I shall fall from my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The valet had seen the movement made by his master at the moment he
      received the order. He went up to him quickly, received the comte in his
      arms, and as they were not yet sufficiently distant from the house for the
      servants, who had remained at the door to watch their master&rsquo;s departure,
      not to perceive the disorder in the usually regular proceeding of the
      comte, the valet called his comrades by gestures and voice, and all
      hastened to his assistance. Athos had gone but a few steps on his return,
      when he felt himself better again. His strength seemed to revive and with
      it the desire to go to Blois. He made his horse turn round: but, at the
      animal&rsquo;s first steps, he sunk again into a state of torpor and anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! decidedly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is <i>willed</i> that I should stay at
      home.&rdquo; His people flocked around him; they lifted him from his horse, and
      carried him as quickly as possible into the house. Everything was prepared
      in his chamber, and they put him to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be sure to remember,&rdquo; said he, disposing himself to sleep, &ldquo;that
      I expect letters from Africa this very day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will no doubt hear with pleasure that Blaisois&rsquo;s son is gone on
      horseback, to gain an hour over the courier of Blois,&rdquo; replied his <i>valet
      de chambre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Athos, with his placid smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comte fell asleep, but his disturbed slumber resembled torture rather
      than repose. The servant who watched him saw several times the expression
      of internal suffering shadowed on his features. Perhaps Athos was
      dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed away. Blaisois&rsquo;s son returned; the courier had brought no
      news. The comte reckoned the minutes with despair; he shuddered when those
      minutes made an hour. The idea that he was forgotten seized him once, and
      brought on a fearful pang of the heart. Everybody in the house had given
      up all hopes of the courier&mdash;his hour had long passed. Four times the
      express sent to Blois had repeated his journey, and there was nothing to
      the address of the comte. Athos knew that the courier only arrived once a
      week. Here, then, was a delay of eight mortal days to be endured. He
      commenced the night in this painful persuasion. All that a sick man,
      irritated by suffering, can add of melancholy suppositions to
      probabilities already gloomy, Athos heaped up during the early hours of
      this dismal night. The fever rose: it invaded the chest, where the fire
      soon caught, according to the expression of the physician, who had been
      brought back from Blois by Blaisois at his last journey. Soon it gained
      the head. The physician made two successive bleedings, which dislodged it
      for the time, but left the patient very weak, and without power of action
      in anything but his brain. And yet this redoubtable fever had ceased. It
      besieged with its last palpitations the tense extremities; it ended by
      yielding as midnight struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician, seeing the incontestable improvement, returned to Blois,
      after having ordered some prescriptions, and declared that the comte was
      saved. Then commenced for Athos a strange, indefinable state. Free to
      think, his mind turned towards Raoul, that beloved son. His imagination
      penetrated the fields of Africa in the environs of Gigelli, where M. de
      Beaufort must have landed with his army. A waste of gray rocks, rendered
      green in certain parts by the waters of the sea, when it lashed the shore
      in storms and tempest. Beyond, the shore, strewed over with these rocks
      like gravestones, ascended, in form of an amphitheater among mastic-trees
      and cactus, a sort of small town, full of smoke, confused noises, and
      terrified movements. All of a sudden, from the bosom of this smoke arose a
      flame, which succeeded, creeping along the houses, in covering the entire
      surface of the town, and increased by degrees, uniting in its red and
      angry vortices tears, screams, and supplicating arms outstretched to
      Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, for a moment, a frightful <i>pele-mele</i> of timbers falling
      to pieces, of swords broken, of stones calcined, trees burnt and
      disappearing. It was a strange thing that in this chaos, in which Athos
      distinguished raised arms, in which he heard cries, sobs, and groans, he
      did not see one human figure. The cannon thundered at a distance, musketry
      madly barked, the sea moaned, flocks made their escape, bounding over the
      verdant slope. But not a soldier to apply the match to the batteries of
      cannon, not a sailor to assist in maneuvering the fleet, not a shepherd in
      charge of the flocks. After the ruin of the village, the destruction of
      the forts which dominated it, a ruin and destruction magically wrought
      without the co-operation of a single human being, the flames were
      extinguished, the smoke began to subside, then diminished in intensity,
      paled and disappeared entirely. Night then came over the scene; night dark
      upon the earth, brilliant in the firmament. The large blazing stars which
      spangled the African sky glittered and gleamed without illuminating
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence ensued, which gave, for a moment, repose to the troubled
      imagination of Athos; and as he felt that that which he saw was not
      terminated, he applied more attentively the eyes of his understanding on
      the strange spectacle which his imagination had presented. This spectacle
      was soon continued for him. A mild pale moon rose behind the declivities
      of the coast, streaking at first the undulating ripples of the sea, which
      appeared to have calmed after the roaring it had sent forth during the
      vision of Athos&mdash;the moon, we say, shed its diamonds and opals upon
      the briers and bushes of the hills. The gray rocks, so many silent and
      attentive phantoms, appeared to raise their heads to examine likewise the
      field of battle by the light of the moon, and Athos perceived that the
      field, empty during the combat, was now strewn with fallen bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inexpressible shudder of fear and horror seized his soul as he
      recognized the white and blue uniforms of the soldiers of Picardy, with
      their long pikes and blue handles, and muskets marked with the <i>fleur-de-lis</i>
      on the butts. When he saw all the gaping wounds, looking up to the bright
      heavens as if to demand back of them the souls to which they had opened a
      passage,&mdash;when he saw the slaughtered horses, stiff, their tongues
      hanging out at one side of their mouths, sleeping in the shiny blood
      congealed around them, staining their furniture and their manes,&mdash;when
      he saw the white horse of M. de Beaufort, with his head beaten to pieces,
      in the first ranks of the dead, Athos passed a cold hand over his brow,
      which he was astonished not to find burning. He was convinced by this
      touch that he was present, as a spectator, without delirium&rsquo;s dreadful
      aid, the day after the battle fought upon the shores of Gigelli by the
      army of the expedition, which he had seen leave the coast of France and
      disappear upon the dim horizon, and of which he had saluted with thought
      and gesture the last cannon-shot fired by the duke as a signal of farewell
      to his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can paint the mortal agony with which his soul followed, like a
      vigilant eye, these effigies of clay-cold soldiers, and examined them, one
      after the other, to see if Raoul slept among them? Who can express the
      intoxication of joy with which Athos bowed before God, and thanked Him for
      not having seen him he sought with so much fear among the dead? In fact,
      fallen in their ranks, stiff, icy, the dead, still recognizable with ease,
      seemed to turn with complacency towards the Comte de la Fere, to be the
      better seen by him, during his sad review. But yet, he was astonished,
      while viewing all these bodies, not to perceive the survivors. To such a
      point did the illusion extend, that this vision was for him a real voyage
      made by the father into Africa, to obtain more exact information
      respecting his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigued, therefore, with having traversed seas and continents, he sought
      repose under one of the tents sheltered behind a rock, on the top of which
      floated the white <i>fleur-de-lised</i> pennon. He looked for a soldier to
      conduct him to the tent of M. de Beaufort. Then, while his eye was
      wandering over the plain, turning on all sides, he saw a white form appear
      behind the scented myrtles. This figure was clothed in the costume of an
      officer; it held in its hand a broken sword; it advanced slowly towards
      Athos, who, stopping short and fixing his eyes upon it, neither spoke nor
      moved, but wished to open his arms, because in this silent officer he had
      already recognized Raoul. The comte attempted to utter a cry, but it was
      stifled in his throat. Raoul, with a gesture, directed him to be silent,
      placing his finger on his lips and drawing back by degrees, without Athos
      being able to see his legs move. The comte, still paler than Raoul,
      followed his son, painfully traversing briers and bushes, stones and
      ditches, Raoul not appearing to touch the earth, no obstacle seeming to
      impede the lightness of his march. The comte, whom the inequalities of the
      path fatigued, soon stopped, exhausted. Raoul still continued to beckon
      him to follow him. The tender father, to whom love restored strength, made
      a last effort, and climbed the mountain after the young man, who attracted
      him by gesture and by smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he gained the crest of the hill, and saw, thrown out in black,
      upon the horizon whitened by the moon, the aerial form of Raoul. Athos
      reached forth his hand to get closer to his beloved son upon the plateau,
      and the latter also stretched out his; but suddenly, as if the young man
      had been drawn away in his own despite, still retreating, he left the
      earth, and Athos saw the clear blue sky shine between the feet of his
      child and the ground of the hill. Raoul rose insensibly into the void,
      smiling, still calling with gesture:&mdash;he departed towards heaven.
      Athos uttered a cry of tenderness and terror. He looked below again. He
      saw a camp destroyed, and all those white bodies of the royal army, like
      so many motionless atoms. And, then, raising his head, he saw the figure
      of his son still beckoning him to climb the mystic void.

    <h2>
      Chapter LVIII. The Angel of Death.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Athos was at this part of his marvelous vision, when the charm was
      suddenly broken by a great noise rising from the outer gates. A horse was
      heard galloping over the hard gravel of the great alley, and the sound of
      noisy and animated conversations ascended to the chamber in which the
      comte was dreaming. Athos did not stir from the place he occupied; he
      scarcely turned his head towards the door to ascertain the sooner what
      these noises could be. A heavy step ascended the stairs; the horse, which
      had recently galloped, departed slowly towards the stables. Great
      hesitation appeared in the steps, which by degrees approached the chamber.
      A door was opened, and Athos, turning a little towards the part of the
      room the noise came from, cried, in a weak voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a courier from Africa, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur le comte,&rdquo; replied a voice which made the father of Raoul
      start upright in his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grimaud!&rdquo; murmured he. And the sweat began to pour down his face. Grimaud
      appeared in the doorway. It was no longer the Grimaud we have seen, still
      young with courage and devotion, when he jumped the first into the boat
      destined to convey Raoul de Bragelonne to the vessels of the royal fleet.
      &lsquo;Twas now a stern and pale old man, his clothes covered with dust, and
      hair whitened by old age. He trembled whilst leaning against the
      door-frame, and was near falling on seeing, by the light of the lamps, the
      countenance of his master. These two men who had lived so long together in
      a community of intelligence, and whose eyes, accustomed to economize
      expressions, knew how to say so many things silently&mdash;these two old
      friends, one as noble as the other in heart, if they were unequal in
      fortune and birth, remained tongue-tied whilst looking at each other. By
      the exchange of a single glance they had just read to the bottom of each
      other&rsquo;s hearts. The old servitor bore upon his countenance the impression
      of a grief already old, the outward token of a grim familiarity with woe.
      He appeared to have no longer in use more than a single version of his
      thoughts. As formerly he was accustomed not to speak much, he was now
      accustomed not to smile at all. Athos read at a glance all these shades
      upon the visage of his faithful servant, and in the same tone he would
      have employed to speak to Raoul in his dream:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grimaud,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Raoul is dead. <i>Is it not so?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind Grimaud the other servants listened breathlessly, with their eyes
      fixed upon the bed of their sick master. They heard the terrible question,
      and a heart-breaking silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the old man, heaving the monosyllable from his chest with a
      hoarse, broken sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arose voices of lamentation, which groaned without measure, and
      filled with regrets and prayers the chamber where the agonized father
      sought with his eyes the portrait of his son. This was for Athos like the
      transition which led to his dream. Without uttering a cry, without
      shedding a tear, patient, mild, resigned as a martyr, he raised his eyes
      towards Heaven, in order there to see again, rising above the mountain of
      Gigelli, the beloved shade that was leaving him at the moment of Grimaud&rsquo;s
      arrival. Without doubt, while looking towards the heavens, resuming his
      marvelous dream, he repassed by the same road by which the vision, at once
      so terrible and sweet, had led him before; for after having gently closed
      his eyes, he reopened them and began to smile: he had just seen Raoul, who
      had smiled upon him. With his hands joined upon his breast, his face
      turned towards the window, bathed by the fresh air of night, which brought
      upon its wings the aroma of the flowers and the woods, Athos entered,
      never again to come out of it, into the contemplation of that paradise
      which the living never see. God willed, no doubt, to open to this elect
      the treasures of eternal beatitude, at this hour when other men tremble
      with the idea of being severely received by the Lord, and cling to this
      life they know, in the dread of the other life of which they get but
      merest glimpses by the dismal murky torch of death. Athos was
      spirit-guided by the pure serene soul of his son, which aspired to be like
      the paternal soul. Everything for this just man was melody and perfume in
      the rough road souls take to return to the celestial country. After an
      hour of this ecstasy, Athos softly raised his hands as white as wax; the
      smile did not quit his lips, and he murmured low, so low as scarcely to be
      audible, these three words addressed to God or to Raoul:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HERE I AM!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his hands fell slowly, as though he himself had laid them on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death had been kind and mild to this noble creature. It had spared him the
      tortures of the agony, convulsions of the last departure; had opened with
      an indulgent finger the gates of eternity to that noble soul. God had no
      doubt ordered it thus that the pious remembrance of this death should
      remain in the hearts of those present, and in the memory of other men&mdash;a
      death which caused to be loved the passage from this life to the other by
      those whose existence upon this earth leads them not to dread the last
      judgment. Athos preserved, even in the eternal sleep, that placid and
      sincere smile&mdash;an ornament which was to accompany him to the tomb.
      The quietude and calm of his fine features made his servants for a long
      time doubt whether he had really quitted life. The comte&rsquo;s people wished
      to remove Grimaud, who, from a distance, devoured the face now quickly
      growing marble-pale, and did not approach, from pious fear of bringing to
      him the breath of death. But Grimaud, fatigued as he was, refused to leave
      the room. He sat himself down upon the threshold, watching his master with
      the vigilance of a sentinel, jealous to receive either his first waking
      look or his last dying sigh. The noises all were quiet in the house&mdash;every
      one respected the slumber of their lord. But Grimaud, by anxiously
      listening, perceived that the comte no longer breathed. He raised himself
      with his hands leaning on the ground, looked to see if there did not
      appear some motion in the body of his master. Nothing! Fear seized him; he
      rose completely up, and, at the very moment, heard some one coming up the
      stairs. A noise of spurs knocking against a sword&mdash;a warlike sound
      familiar to his ears&mdash;stopped him as he was going towards the bed of
      Athos. A voice more sonorous than brass or steel resounded within three
      paces of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athos! Athos! my friend!&rdquo; cried this voice, agitated even to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Chevalier d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; faltered out Grimaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? Where is he?&rdquo; continued the musketeer. Grimaud seized his
      arm in his bony fingers, and pointed to the bed, upon the sheets of which
      the livid tints of death already showed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A choked respiration, the opposite to a sharp cry, swelled the throat of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan. He advanced on tip-toe, trembling, frightened at the noise his
      feet made on the floor, his heart rent by a nameless agony. He placed his
      ear to the breast of Athos, his face to the comte&rsquo;s mouth. Neither noise,
      nor breath! D&rsquo;Artagnan drew back. Grimaud, who had followed him with his
      eyes, and for whom each of his movements had been a revelation, came
      timidly; seated himself at the foot of the bed, and glued his lips to the
      sheet which was raised by the stiffened feet of his master. Then large
      drops began to flow from his red eyes. This old man in invincible despair,
      who wept, bent doubled without uttering a word, presented the most
      touching spectacle that D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a life so filled with emotion, had
      ever met with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain resumed standing in contemplation before that smiling dead
      man, who seemed to have burnished his last thought, to give his best
      friend, the man he had loved next to Raoul, a gracious welcome even beyond
      life. And for reply to that exalted flattery of hospitality, D&rsquo;Artagnan
      went and kissed Athos fervently on the brow, and with his trembling
      fingers closed his eyes. Then he seated himself by the pillow without
      dread of that dead man, who had been so kind and affectionate to him for
      five and thirty years. He was feeding his soul with the remembrances the
      noble visage of the comte brought to his mind in crowds&mdash;some
      blooming and charming as that smile&mdash;some dark, dismal, and icy as
      that visage with its eyes now closed to all eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the bitter flood which mounted from minute to minute invaded
      his heart, and swelled his breast almost to bursting. Incapable of
      mastering his emotion, he arose, and tearing himself violently from the
      chamber where he had just found dead him to whom he came to report the
      news of the death of Porthos, he uttered sobs so heart-rending that the
      servants, who seemed only to wait for an explosion of grief, answered to
      it by their lugubrious clamors, and the dogs of the late comte by their
      lamentable howlings. Grimaud was the only one who did not lift up his
      voice. Even in the paroxysm of his grief he would not have dared to
      profane the dead, or for the first time disturb the slumber of his master.
      Had not Athos always bidden him be dumb?
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak D&rsquo;Artagnan, who had wandered about the lower hall, biting his
      fingers to stifle his sighs&mdash;D&rsquo;Artagnan went up once more; and
      watching the moments when Grimaud turned his head towards him, he made him
      a sign to come to him, which the faithful servant obeyed without making
      more noise than a shadow. D&rsquo;Artagnan went down again, followed by Grimaud;
      and when he had gained the vestibule, taking the old man&rsquo;s hands,
      &ldquo;Grimaud,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have seen how the father died; now let me know
      about the son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud drew from his breast a large letter, upon the envelope of which
      was traced the address of Athos. He recognized the writing of M. de
      Beaufort, broke the seal, and began to read, while walking about in the
      first steel-chill rays of dawn, in the dark alley of old limes, marked by
      the still visible footsteps of the comte who had just died.

    <p>
      The Duc de Beaufort wrote to Athos. The letter destined for the living
      only reached the dead. God had changed the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR COMTE,&rdquo; wrote the prince, in his large, school-boy&rsquo;s hand,&mdash;&ldquo;a
      great misfortune has struck us amidst a great triumph. The king loses one
      of the bravest of soldiers. I lose a friend. You lose M. de Bragelonne. He
      has died gloriously, so gloriously that I have not the strength to weep as
      I could wish. Receive my sad compliments, my dear comte. Heaven
      distributes trials according to the greatness of our hearts. This is an
      immense one, but not above your courage. Your good friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LE DUC DE BEAUFORT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter contained a relation written by one of the prince&rsquo;s
      secretaries. It was the most touching recital, and the most true, of that
      dismal episode which unraveled two existences. D&rsquo;Artagnan, accustomed to
      battle emotions, and with a heart armed against tenderness, could not help
      starting on reading the name of Raoul, the name of that beloved boy who
      had become a shade now&mdash;like his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; said the prince&rsquo;s secretary, &ldquo;monseigneur commanded the
      attack. Normandy and Picardy had taken positions in the rocks dominated by
      the heights of the mountain, upon the declivity of which were raised the
      bastions of Gigelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cannon opened the action; the regiments marched full of resolution;
      the pikemen with pikes elevated, the musket-bearers with their weapons
      ready. The prince followed attentively the march and movements of the
      troops, so as to be able to sustain them with a strong reserve. With
      monseigneur were the oldest captains and his aides-de-camp. M. le Vicomte
      de Bragelonne had received orders not to leave his highness. In the
      meantime the enemy&rsquo;s cannon, which at first thundered with little success
      against the masses, began to regulate their fire, and the balls, better
      directed, killed several men near the prince. The regiments formed in
      column, and, advancing against the ramparts, were rather roughly handled.
      There was a sort of hesitation in our troops, who found themselves
      ill-seconded by the artillery. In fact, the batteries which had been
      established the evening before had but a weak and uncertain aim, on
      account of their position. The upward direction of the aim lessened the
      justness of the shots as well as their range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, comprehending the bad effect of this position on the siege
      artillery, commanded the frigates moored in the little road to commence a
      regular fire against the place. M. de Bragelonne offered himself at once
      to carry this order. But monseigneur refused to acquiesce in the vicomte&rsquo;s
      request. Monseigneur was right, for he loved and wished to spare the young
      nobleman. He was quite right, and the event took upon itself to justify
      his foresight and refusal; for scarcely had the sergeant charged with the
      message solicited by M. de Bragelonne gained the seashore, when two shots
      from long carbines issued from the enemy&rsquo;s ranks and laid him low. The
      sergeant fell, dyeing the sand with his blood; observing which, M. de
      Bragelonne smiled at monseigneur, who said to him, &lsquo;You see, vicomte, I
      have saved your life. Report that, some day, to M. le Comte de la Fere, in
      order that, learning it from you, he may thank me.&rsquo; The young nobleman
      smiled sadly, and replied to the duke, &lsquo;It is true, monseigneur, that but
      for your kindness I should have been killed, where the poor sergeant has
      fallen, and should be at rest.&rsquo; M. de Bragelonne made this reply in such a
      tone that monseigneur answered him warmly, &lsquo;<i>Vrai Dieu!</i> Young man,
      one would say that your mouth waters for death; but, by the soul of Henry
      IV., I have promised your father to bring you back alive; and, please the
      Lord, I mean to keep my word.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur de Bragelonne colored, and replied, in a lower voice,
      &lsquo;Monseigneur, pardon me, I beseech you. I have always had a desire to meet
      good opportunities; and it is so delightful to distinguish ourselves
      before our general, particularly when that general is M. le Duc de
      Beaufort.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur was a little softened by this; and, turning to the officers
      who surrounded him, gave different orders. The grenadiers of the two
      regiments got near enough to the ditches and intrenchments to launch their
      grenades, which had but small effect. In the meanwhile, M. d&rsquo;Estrees, who
      commanded the fleet, having seen the attempt of the sergeant to approach
      the vessels, understood that he must act without orders, and opened fire.
      Then the Arabs, finding themselves seriously injured by the balls from the
      fleet, and beholding the destruction and the ruin of their walls, uttered
      the most fearful cries. Their horsemen descended the mountain at a gallop,
      bent over their saddles, and rushed full tilt upon the columns of
      infantry, which, crossing their pikes, stopped this mad assault. Repulsed
      by the firm attitude of the battalion, the Arabs threw themselves with
      fury towards the <i>etat-major</i>, which was not on its guard at that
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The danger was great; monseigneur drew his sword; his secretaries and
      people imitated him; the officers of the suite engaged in combat with the
      furious Arabs. It was then M. de Bragelonne was able to satisfy the
      inclination he had so clearly shown from the commencement of the action.
      He fought near the prince with the valor of a Roman, and killed three
      Arabs with his small sword. But it was evident that his bravery did not
      arise from that sentiment of pride so natural to all who fight. It was
      impetuous, affected, even forced; he sought to glut, intoxicate himself
      with strife and carnage. He excited himself to such a degree that
      monseigneur called to him to stop. He must have heard the voice of
      monseigneur, because we who were close to him heard it. He did not,
      however, stop, but continued his course to the intrenchments. As M. de
      Bragelonne was a well-disciplined officer, this disobedience to the orders
      of monseigneur very much surprised everybody, and M. de Beaufort redoubled
      his earnestness, crying, &lsquo;Stop, Bragelonne! Where are you going? Stop,&rsquo;
      repeated monseigneur, &lsquo;I command you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all, imitating the gesture of M. le duc, we all raised our hands. We
      expected that the cavalier would turn bridle; but M. de Bragelonne
      continued to ride towards the palisades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Stop, Bragelonne!&rsquo; repeated the prince, in a very loud voice, &lsquo;stop! in
      the name of your father!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At these words M. de Bragelonne turned round; his countenance expressed a
      lively grief, but he did not stop; we then concluded that his horse must
      have run away with him. When M. le duc saw cause to conclude that the
      vicomte was no longer master of his horse, and had watched him precede the
      first grenadiers, his highness cried, &lsquo;Musketeers, kill his horse! A
      hundred pistoles for the man who kills his horse!&rsquo; But who could expect to
      hit the beast without at least wounding his rider? No one dared the
      attempt. At length one presented himself; he was a sharp-shooter of the
      regiment of Picardy, named Luzerne, who took aim at the animal, fired, and
      hit him in the quarters, for we saw the blood redden the hair of the
      horse. Instead of falling, the cursed jennet was irritated, and carried
      him on more furiously than ever. Every Picard who saw this unfortunate
      young man rushing on to meet certain death, shouted in the loudest manner,
      &lsquo;Throw yourself off, monsieur le vicomte!&mdash;off!&mdash;off! throw
      yourself off!&rsquo; M. de Bragelonne was an officer much beloved in the army.
      Already had the vicomte arrived within pistol-shot of the ramparts, when a
      discharge was poured upon him that enshrouded him in fire and smoke. We
      lost sight of him; the smoke dispersed; he was on foot, upright; his horse
      was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vicomte was summoned to surrender by the Arabs, but he made them a
      negative sign with his head, and continued to march towards the palisades.
      This was a mortal imprudence. Nevertheless the entire army was pleased
      that he would not retreat, since ill-chance had led him so near. He
      marched a few paces further, and the two regiments clapped their hands. It
      was at this moment the second discharge shook the walls, and the Vicomte
      de Bragelonne again disappeared in the smoke; but this time the smoke
      dispersed in vain; we no longer saw him standing. He was down, with his
      head lower than his legs, among the bushes, and the Arabs began to think
      of leaving their intrenchments to come and cut off his head or take his
      body&mdash;as is the custom with the infidels. But Monseigneur le Duc de
      Beaufort had followed all this with his eyes, and the sad spectacle drew
      from him many painful sighs. He then cried aloud, seeing the Arabs running
      like white phantoms among the mastic-trees, &lsquo;Grenadiers! lancers! will you
      let them take that noble body?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saying these words and waving his sword, he himself rode towards the
      enemy. The regiments, rushing in his steps, ran in their turn, uttering
      cries as terrible as those of the Arabs were wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The combat commenced over the body of M. de Bragelonne, and with such
      inveteracy was it fought that a hundred and sixty Arabs were left upon the
      field, by the side of at least fifty of our troops. It was a lieutenant
      from Normandy who took the body of the vicomte on his shoulders and
      carried it back to the lines. The advantage was, however, pursued, the
      regiments took the reserve with them, and the enemy&rsquo;s palisades were
      utterly destroyed. At three o&rsquo;clock the fire of the Arabs ceased; the
      hand-to-hand fight lasted two hours; it was a massacre. At five o&rsquo;clock we
      were victorious at all points; the enemy had abandoned his positions, and
      M. le duc ordered the white flag to be planted on the summit of the little
      mountain. It was then we had time to think of M. de Bragelonne, who had
      eight large wounds in his body, through which almost all his blood had
      welled away. Still, however, he had breathed, which afforded inexpressible
      joy to monseigneur, who insisted on being present at the first dressing of
      the wounds and the consultation of the surgeons. There were two among them
      who declared M. de Bragelonne would live. Monseigneur threw his arms
      around their necks, and promised them a thousand louis each if they could
      save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vicomte heard these transports of joy, and whether he was in despair,
      or whether he suffered much from his wounds, he expressed by his
      countenance a contradiction, which gave rise to reflection, particularly
      in one of the secretaries when he had heard what follows. The third
      surgeon was the brother of Sylvain de Saint-Cosme, the most learned of
      them all. He probed the wounds in his turn, and said nothing. M. de
      Bragelonne fixed his eyes steadily upon the skillful surgeon, and seemed
      to interrogate his every movement. The latter, upon being questioned by
      monseigneur, replied that he saw plainly three mortal wounds out of eight,
      but so strong was the constitution of the wounded, so rich was he in
      youth, and so merciful was the goodness of God, that perhaps M. de
      Bragelonne might recover, particularly if he did not move in the slightest
      manner. Frere Sylvain added, turning towards his assistants, &lsquo;Above
      everything, do not allow him to move, even a finger, or you will kill
      him;&rsquo; and we all left the tent in very low spirits. That secretary I have
      mentioned, on leaving the tent, thought he perceived a faint and sad smile
      glide over the lips of M. de Bragelonne when the duke said to him, in a
      cheerful, kind voice, &lsquo;We will save you, vicomte, we will save you yet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the evening, when it was believed the wounded youth had taken some
      repose, one of the assistants entered his tent, but rushed out again
      immediately, uttering loud cries. We all ran up in disorder, M. le duc
      with us, and the assistant pointed to the body of M. de Bragelonne upon
      the ground, at the foot of his bed, bathed in the remainder of his blood.
      It appeared that he had suffered some convulsion, some delirium, and that
      he had fallen; that the fall had accelerated his end, according to the
      prognosis of Frere Sylvain. We raised the vicomte; he was cold and dead.
      He held a lock of fair hair in his right hand, and that hand was tightly
      pressed upon his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the details of the expedition, and of the victory obtained
      over the Arabs. D&rsquo;Artagnan stopped at the account of the death of poor
      Raoul. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;unhappy boy! a suicide!&rdquo; And turning his eyes
      towards the chamber of the chateau, in which Athos slept in eternal sleep,
      &ldquo;They kept their words with each other,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice; &ldquo;now I
      believe them to be happy; they must be reunited.&rdquo; And he returned through
      the parterre with slow and melancholy steps. All the village&mdash;all the
      neighborhood&mdash;were filled with grieving neighbors relating to each
      other the double catastrophe, and making preparations for the funeral.

    <h2>
      Chapter LX. The Last Canto of the Poem.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morrow, all the <i>noblesse</i> of the provinces, of the environs,
      and wherever messengers had carried the news, might have been seen
      arriving in detachments. D&rsquo;Artagnan had shut himself up, without being
      willing to speak to anybody. Two such heavy deaths falling upon the
      captain, so closely after the death of Porthos, for a long time oppressed
      that spirit which had hitherto been so indefatigable and invulnerable.
      Except Grimaud, who entered his chamber once, the musketeer saw neither
      servants nor guests. He supposed, from the noises in the house, and the
      continual coming and going, that preparations were being made for the
      funeral of the comte. He wrote to the king to ask for an extension of his
      leave of absence. Grimaud, as we have said, had entered D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s
      apartment, had seated himself upon a joint-stool near the door, like a man
      who meditates profoundly; then, rising, he made a sign to D&rsquo;Artagnan to
      follow him. The latter obeyed in silence. Grimaud descended to the comte&rsquo;s
      bed-chamber, showed the captain with his finger the place of the empty
      bed, and raised his eyes eloquently towards Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;yes, good Grimaud&mdash;now with the son he
      loved so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud left the chamber, and led the way to the hall, where, according to
      the custom of the province, the body was laid out, previously to being put
      away forever. D&rsquo;Artagnan was struck at seeing two open coffins in the
      hall. In reply to the mute invitation of Grimaud, he approached, and saw
      in one of them Athos, still handsome in death, and, in the other, Raoul
      with his eyes closed, his cheeks pearly as those of the Palls of Virgil,
      with a smile on his violet lips. He shuddered at seeing the father and
      son, those two departed souls, represented on earth by two silent,
      melancholy bodies, incapable of touching each other, however close they
      might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul here!&rdquo; murmured he. &ldquo;Oh! Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud shook his head, and made no reply; but taking D&rsquo;Artagnan by the
      hand, he led him to the coffin, and showed him, under the thin
      winding-sheet, the black wounds by which life had escaped. The captain
      turned away his eyes, and, judging it was useless to question Grimaud, who
      would not answer, he recollected that M. de Beaufort&rsquo;s secretary had
      written more than he, D&rsquo;Artagnan, had had the courage to read. Taking up
      the recital of the affair which had cost Raoul his life, he found these
      words, which ended the concluding paragraph of the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur le duc has ordered that the body of monsieur le vicomte
      should be embalmed, after the manner practiced by the Arabs when they wish
      their dead to be carried to their native land; and monsieur le duc has
      appointed relays, so that the same confidential servant who brought up the
      young man might take back his remains to M. le Comte de la Fere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I shall follow thy funeral, my dear boy&mdash;I,
      already old&mdash;I, who am of no value on earth&mdash;and I shall scatter
      dust upon that brow I kissed but two months since. God has willed it to be
      so. Thou hast willed it to be so, thyself. I have no longer the right even
      to weep. Thou hast chosen death; it seemed to thee a preferable gift to
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length arrived the moment when the chill remains of these two gentlemen
      were to be given back to mother earth. There was such an affluence of
      military and other people that up to the place of the sepulture, which was
      a little chapel on the plain, the road from the city was filled with
      horsemen and pedestrians in mourning. Athos had chosen for his
      resting-place the little inclosure of a chapel erected by himself near the
      boundary of his estates. He had had the stones, cut in 1550, brought from
      an old Gothic manor-house in Berry, which had sheltered his early youth.
      The chapel, thus rebuilt, transported, was pleasing to the eye beneath its
      leafy curtains of poplars and sycamores. It was ministered in every
      Sunday, by the cure of the neighboring bourg, to whom Athos paid an
      allowance of two hundred francs for this service; and all the vassals of
      his domain, with their families, came thither to hear mass, without having
      any occasion to go to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the chapel extended, surrounded by two high hedges of hazel, elder
      and white thorn, and a deep ditch, the little inclosure&mdash;uncultivated,
      though gay in its sterility; because the mosses there grew thick, wild
      heliotrope and ravenelles there mingled perfumes, while from beneath an
      ancient chestnut issued a crystal spring, a prisoner in its marble
      cistern, and on the thyme all around alighted thousands of bees from the
      neighboring plants, whilst chaffinches and redthroats sang cheerfully
      among the flower-spangled hedges. It was to this place the somber coffins
      were carried, attended by a silent and respectful crowd. The office of the
      dead being celebrated, the last adieux paid to the noble departed, the
      assembly dispersed, talking, along the roads, of the virtues and mild
      death of the father, of the hopes the son had given, and of his melancholy
      end upon the arid coast of Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, all noises were extinguished, like the lamps
      illuminating the humble nave. The minister bowed for the last time to the
      altar and the still fresh graves; then, followed by his assistant, he
      slowly took the road back to the presbytery. D&rsquo;Artagnan, left alone,
      perceived that night was coming on. He had forgotten the hour, thinking
      only of the dead. He arose from the oaken bench on which he was seated in
      the chapel, and wished, as the priest had done, to go and bid a last adieu
      to the double grave which contained his two lost friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman was praying, kneeling on the moist earth. D&rsquo;Artagnan stopped at
      the door of the chapel, to avoid disturbing her, and also to endeavor to
      find out who was the pious friend who performed this sacred duty with so
      much zeal and perseverance. The unknown had hidden her face in her hands,
      which were white as alabaster. From the noble simplicity of her costume,
      she must be a woman of distinction. Outside the inclosure were several
      horses mounted by servants; a travelling carriage was in waiting for this
      lady. D&rsquo;Artagnan in vain sought to make out what caused her delay. She
      continued praying, and frequently pressed her handkerchief to her face, by
      which D&rsquo;Artagnan perceived she was weeping. He beheld her strike her
      breast with the compunction of a Christian woman. He heard her several
      times exclaim as from a wounded heart: &ldquo;Pardon! pardon!&rdquo; And as she
      appeared to abandon herself entirely to her grief, as she threw herself
      down, almost fainting, exhausted by complaints and prayers, D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      touched by this love for his so much regretted friends, made a few steps
      towards the grave, in order to interrupt the melancholy colloquy of the
      penitent with the dead. But as soon as his step sounded on the gravel, the
      unknown raised her head, revealing to D&rsquo;Artagnan a face aflood with tears,
      a well-known face. It was Mademoiselle de la Valliere! &ldquo;Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; murmured she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; replied the captain, in a stern voice, &ldquo;you here!&mdash;oh! madame,
      I should better have liked to see you decked with flowers in the mansion
      of the Comte de la Fere. You would have wept less&mdash;and they too&mdash;and
      I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; said she, sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For it was you,&rdquo; added this pitiless friend of the dead,&mdash;&ldquo;it was
      you who sped these two men to the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! spare me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, madame, that I should offend a woman, or that I should make
      her weep in vain; but I must say that the place of the murderer is not
      upon the grave of her victims.&rdquo; She wished to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I now tell you,&rdquo; added he, coldly, &ldquo;I have already told the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have caused the death of the
      Vicomte de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news arrived at court yesterday. I have traveled during the night
      forty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte, whom I supposed to be
      still living, and to pray God, on the tomb of Raoul, that he would send me
      all the misfortunes I have merited, except a single one. Now, monsieur, I
      know that the death of the son has killed the father; I have two crimes to
      reproach myself with; I have two punishments to expect from Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will repeat to you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;what M. de
      Bragelonne said of you, at Antibes, when he already meditated death: &lsquo;If
      pride and coquetry have misled her, I pardon her while despising her. If
      love has produced her error, I pardon her, but I swear that no one could
      have loved her as I have done.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; interrupted Louise, &ldquo;that of my love I was about to sacrifice
      myself; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost, dying,
      abandoned. Well! never have I suffered so much as now; because then I
      hoped, desired,&mdash;now I have no longer anything to wish for; because
      this death drags all my joy into the tomb; because I can no longer dare to
      love without remorse, and I feel that he whom I love&mdash;oh! it is but
      just!&mdash;will repay me with the tortures I have made others undergo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made no reply; he was too well convinced that she was not
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, do not overwhelm me
      to-day, I again implore you! I am like the branch torn from the trunk, I
      no longer hold to anything in this world&mdash;a current drags me on, I
      know not whither. I love madly, even to the point of coming to tell it,
      wretch that I am, over the ashes of the dead, and I do not blush for it&mdash;I
      have no remorse on this account. Such love is a religion. Only, as
      hereafter you will see me alone, forgotten, disdained; as you will see me
      punished, as I am destined to be punished, spare me in my ephemeral
      happiness, leave it to me for a few days, for a few minutes. Now, even at
      the moment I am speaking to you, perhaps it no longer exists. My God! this
      double murder is perhaps already expiated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she was speaking thus, the sound of voices and of horses drew the
      attention of the captain. M. de Saint-Aignan came to seek La Valliere.
      &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a prey to jealousy and uneasiness.&rdquo; Saint-Aignan
      did not perceive D&rsquo;Artagnan, half concealed by the trunk of a
      chestnut-tree which shaded the double grave. Louise thanked Saint-Aignan,
      and dismissed him with a gesture. He rejoined the party outside the
      inclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, madame,&rdquo; said the captain bitterly to the young woman,&mdash;&ldquo;you
      see your happiness still lasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman raised her head with a solemn air. &ldquo;A day will come,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;when you will repent of having so misjudged me. On that day, it is I
      who will pray God to forgive you for having been unjust towards me.
      Besides, I shall suffer so much that you yourself will be the first to
      pity my sufferings. Do not reproach me with my fleeting happiness,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan; it costs me dear, and I have not paid all my debt.&rdquo;
       Saying these words, she again knelt down, softly and affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me the last time, my affianced Raoul!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have broken
      our chain; we are both destined to die of grief. It is thou who departest
      first; fear nothing, I shall follow thee. See, only, that I have not been
      base, and that I have come to bid thee this last adieu. The Lord is my
      witness, Raoul, that if with my life I could have redeemed thine, I would
      have given that life without hesitation. I could not give my love. Once
      more, forgive me, dearest, kindest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She strewed a few sweet flowers on the freshly sodded earth; then, wiping
      the tears from her eyes, the heavily stricken lady bowed to D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain watched the departure of the horses, horsemen, and carriage,
      then crossing his arms upon his swelling chest, &ldquo;When will it be my turn
      to depart?&rdquo; said he, in an agitated voice. &ldquo;What is there left for man
      after youth, love, glory, friendship, strength, and wealth have
      disappeared? That rock, under which sleeps Porthos, who possessed all I
      have named; this moss, under which repose Athos and Raoul, who possessed
      much more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated for a moment, with a dull eye; then, drawing himself up,
      &ldquo;Forward! still forward!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When it is time, God will tell me, as
      he foretold the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched the earth, moistened with the evening dew, with the ends of his
      fingers, signed himself as if he had been at the <i>benitier</i> in
      church, and retook alone&mdash;ever alone&mdash;the road to Paris.

    <h2>
      Epilogue.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Four years after the scene we have just described, two horsemen, well
      mounted, traversed Blois early in the morning, for the purpose of
      arranging a hawking party the king had arranged to make in that uneven
      plain the Loire divides in two, which borders on the one side Meung, on
      the other Amboise. These were the keeper of the king&rsquo;s harriers and the
      master of the falcons, personages greatly respected in the time of Louis
      XIII., but rather neglected by his successor. The horsemen, having
      reconnoitered the ground, were returning, their observations made, when
      they perceived certain little groups of soldiers, here and there, whom the
      sergeants were placing at distances at the openings of the inclosures.
      These were the king&rsquo;s musketeers. Behind them came, upon a splendid horse,
      the captain, known by his richly embroidered uniform. His hair was gray,
      his beard turning so. He seemed a little bent, although sitting and
      handling his horse gracefully. He was looking about him watchfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan does not get any older,&rdquo; said the keeper of the harriers to
      his colleague the falconer; &ldquo;with ten years more to carry than either of
      us, he has the seat of a young man on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied the falconer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any change in him for
      the last twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this officer was mistaken; D&rsquo;Artagnan in the last four years had lived
      a dozen. Age had printed its pitiless claws at each angle of his eyes; his
      brow was bald; his hands, formerly brown and nervous, were getting white,
      as if the blood had half forgotten them.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan accosted the officers with the shade of affability which
      distinguishes superiors, and received in turn for his courtesy two most
      respectful bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what a lucky chance to see you here, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo; cried the
      falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather I who should say that, messieurs,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;for
      nowadays, the king makes more frequent use of his musketeers than of his
      falcons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is not as it was in the good old times,&rdquo; sighed the falconer. &ldquo;Do
      you remember, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, when the late king flew the pie in the
      vineyards beyond Beaugence? Ah! <i>dame!</i> you were not the captain of
      the musketeers at that time, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-7"
       name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were nothing but under-corporal of the tiercelets,&rdquo; replied
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, laughing. &ldquo;Never mind that, it was a good time, seeing that it
      is always a good time when we are young. Good day, monsieur the keeper of
      the harriers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me honor, monsieur le comte,&rdquo; said the latter. D&rsquo;Artagnan made no
      reply. The title of comte had hardly struck him; D&rsquo;Artagnan had been a
      comte four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not very much fatigued with the long journey you have taken,
      monsieur le capitaine?&rdquo; continued the falconer. &ldquo;It must be full two
      hundred leagues from hence to Pignerol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and sixty to go, and as many to return,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the falconer, &ldquo;is <i>he</i> well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, poor M. Fouquet,&rdquo; continued the falconer, in a low voice. The keeper
      of the harriers had prudently withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;the poor man frets terribly; he cannot
      comprehend how imprisonment can be a favor; he says that parliament
      absolved him by banishing him, and banishment is, or should be, liberty.
      He cannot imagine that they had sworn his death, and that to save his life
      from the claws of parliament was to be under too much obligation to
      Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes; the poor man had a close chance of the scaffold,&rdquo; replied the
      falconer; &ldquo;it is said that M. Colbert had given orders to the governor of
      the Bastile, and that the execution was ordered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, pensively, and with a view of cutting short the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the keeper of the harriers, drawing towards them, &ldquo;M. Fouquet
      is now at Pignerol; he has richly deserved it. He had the good fortune to
      be conducted there by you; he robbed the king sufficiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan launched at the master of the dogs one of his crossest looks,
      and said to him, &ldquo;Monsieur, if any one told me you had eaten your dogs&rsquo;
      meat, not only would I refuse to believe it; but still more, if you were
      condemned to the lash or to jail for it, I should pity you and would not
      allow people to speak ill of you. And yet, monsieur, honest man as you may
      be, I assure you that you are not more so than poor M. Fouquet was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After having undergone this sharp rebuke, the keeper of the harriers hung
      his head, and allowed the falconer to get two steps in advance of him
      nearer to D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is content,&rdquo; said the falconer, in a low voice, to the musketeer; &ldquo;we
      all know that harriers are in fashion nowadays; if he were a falconer he
      would not talk in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan smiled in a melancholy manner at seeing this great political
      question resolved by the discontent of such humble interest. He for a
      moment ran over in his mind the glorious existence of the surintendant,
      the crumbling of his fortunes, and the melancholy death that awaited him;
      and to conclude, &ldquo;Did M. Fouquet love falconry?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, passionately, monsieur!&rdquo; repeated the falconer, with an accent of
      bitter regret and a sigh that was the funeral oration of Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan allowed the ill-humor of the one and the regret of the other to
      pass, and continued to advance. They could already catch glimpses of the
      huntsmen at the issue of the wood, the feathers of the outriders passing
      like shooting stars across the clearings, and the white horses skirting
      the bosky thickets looking like illuminated apparitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;will the sport last long? Pray, give us a good
      swift bird, for I am very tired. Is it a heron or a swan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the falconer; &ldquo;but you need not be
      alarmed; the king is not much of a sportsman; he does not take the field
      on his own account, he only wishes to amuse the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words &ldquo;to amuse the ladies&rdquo; were so strongly accented they set
      D&rsquo;Artagnan thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, looking keenly at the falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keeper of the harriers smiled, no doubt with a view of making it up
      with the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you may safely laugh,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;I know nothing of current
      news; I only arrived yesterday, after a month&rsquo;s absence. I left the court
      mourning the death of the queen-mother. The king was not willing to take
      any amusement after receiving the last sigh of Anne of Austria; but
      everything comes to an end in this world. Well! then he is no longer sad?
      So much the better.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8"
       id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And everything begins as well as ends,&rdquo; said the keeper with a coarse
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, a second time,&mdash;he burned to know, but dignity
      would not allow him to interrogate people below him,&mdash;&ldquo;there is
      something beginning, then, it seems?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The keeper gave him a significant wink; but D&rsquo;Artagnan was unwilling to
      learn anything from this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we see the king early?&rdquo; asked he of the falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At seven o&rsquo;clock, monsieur, I shall fly the birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who comes with the king? How is Madame? How is the queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she been ill, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, since the last chagrin she suffered, her majesty has been
      unwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What chagrin? You need not fancy your news is old. I have but just
      returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears that the queen, a little neglected since the death of her
      mother-in-law, complained to the king, who answered her,&mdash;&lsquo;Do I not
      sleep at home every night, madame? What more do you expect?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan,&mdash;&ldquo;poor woman! She must heartily hate
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! not Mademoiselle de la Valliere,&rdquo; replied the falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who then&mdash;&rdquo; The blast of a hunting-horn interrupted this
      conversation. It summoned the dogs and the hawks. The falconer and his
      companions set off immediately, leaving D&rsquo;Artagnan alone in the midst of
      the suspended sentence. The king appeared at a distance, surrounded by
      ladies and horsemen. All the troop advanced in beautiful order, at a
      foot&rsquo;s pace, the horns of various sorts animating the dogs and horses.
      There was an animation in the scene, a mirage of light, of which nothing
      now can give an idea, unless it be the fictitious splendor of a theatric
      spectacle. D&rsquo;Artagnan, with an eye a little, just a little, dimmed by age,
      distinguished behind the group three carriages. The first was intended for
      the queen; it was empty. D&rsquo;Artagnan, who did not see Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere by the king&rsquo;s side, on looking about for her, saw her in the
      second carriage. She was alone with two of her women, who seemed as dull
      as their mistress. On the left hand of the king, upon a high-spirited
      horse, restrained by a bold and skillful hand, shone a lady of most
      dazzling beauty. The king smiled upon her, and she smiled upon the king.
      Loud laughter followed every word she uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must know that woman,&rdquo; thought the musketeer; &ldquo;who can she be?&rdquo; And he
      stooped towards his friend, the falconer, to whom he addressed the
      question he had put to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The falconer was about to reply, when the king, perceiving D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      &ldquo;Ah, comte!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are amongst us once more then! Why have I not
      seen you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;because your majesty was asleep when I
      arrived, and not awake when I resumed my duties this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still the same,&rdquo; said Louis, in a loud voice, denoting satisfaction.
      &ldquo;Take some rest, comte; I command you to do so. You will dine with me
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of admiration surrounded D&rsquo;Artagnan like a caress. Every one was
      eager to salute him. Dining with the king was an honor his majesty was not
      so prodigal of as Henry IV. had been. The king passed a few steps in
      advance, and D&rsquo;Artagnan found himself in the midst of a fresh group, among
      whom shone Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the minister, with marked
      affability, &ldquo;have you had a pleasant journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, bowing to the neck of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the king invite you to his table for this evening,&rdquo; continued the
      minister; &ldquo;you will meet an old friend there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old friend of mine?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan, plunging painfully into the
      dark waves of the past, which had swallowed up for him so many friendships
      and so many hatreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Duc d&rsquo;Almeda, who is arrived this morning from Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duc d&rsquo;Almeda?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, reflecting in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried an old man, white as snow, sitting bent in his carriage,
      which he caused to be thrown open to make room for the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Aramis!</i>&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, struck with profound amazement. And he
      felt, inert as it was, the thin arm of the old nobleman hanging round his
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colbert, after having observed them in silence for a few moments, urged
      his horse forward, and left the two old friends together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said the musketeer, taking Aramis&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;you, the exile, the
      rebel, are again in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! and I shall dine with you at the king&rsquo;s table,&rdquo; said Aramis, smiling.
      &ldquo;Yes, will you not ask yourself what is the use of fidelity in this world?
      Stop! let us allow poor La Valliere&rsquo;s carriage to pass. Look, how uneasy
      she is! How her eyes, dim with tears, follow the king, who is riding on
      horseback yonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, now Madame de Montespan,&rdquo; replied
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is jealous. Is she then deserted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite yet, but it will not be long before she <i>is</i>.&rdquo; <a
      href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      They chatted together, while following the sport, and Aramis&rsquo;s coachman
      drove them so cleverly that they arrived at the instant when the falcon,
      attacking the bird, beat him down, and fell upon him. The king alighted;
      Madame de Montespan followed his example. They were in front of an
      isolated chapel, concealed by huge trees, already despoiled of their
      leaves by the first cutting winds of autumn. Behind this chapel was an
      inclosure, closed by a latticed gate. The falcon had beaten down his prey
      in the inclosure belonging to this little chapel, and the king was
      desirous of going in to take the first feather, according to custom. The
      <i>cortege</i> formed a circle round the building and the hedges, too
      small to receive so many. D&rsquo;Artagnan held back Aramis by the arm, as he
      was about, like the rest, to alight from his carriage, and in a hoarse,
      broken voice, &ldquo;Do you know, Aramis,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whither chance has
      conducted us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here repose men that we knew well,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, greatly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, without divining anything, and with a trembling step, penetrated
      into the chapel by a little door which D&rsquo;Artagnan opened for him. &ldquo;Where
      are they buried?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, in the inclosure. There is a cross, you see, beneath yon little
      cypress. The tree of grief is planted over their tomb; don&rsquo;t go to it; the
      king is going that way; the heron has fallen just there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis stopped, and concealed himself in the shade. They then saw, without
      being seen, the pale face of La Valliere, who, neglected in her carriage,
      at first looked on, with a melancholy heart, from the door, and then,
      carried away by jealousy, advanced into the chapel, whence, leaning
      against a pillar, she contemplated the king smiling and making signs to
      Madame de Montespan to approach, as there was nothing to be afraid of.
      Madame de Montespan complied; she took the hand the king held out to her,
      and he, plucking out the first feather from the heron, which the falconer
      had strangled, placed it in his beautiful companion&rsquo;s hat. She, smiling in
      her turn, kissed the hand tenderly which made her this present. The king
      grew scarlet with vanity and pleasure; he looked at Madame de Montespan
      with all the fire of new love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you give me in exchange?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off a little branch of cypress and offered it to the king, who
      looked intoxicated with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Aramis to D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;the present is but a sad one, for
      that cypress shades a tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the tomb is that of Raoul de Bragelonne,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan aloud;
      &ldquo;of Raoul, who sleeps under that cross with his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A groan resounded&mdash;they saw a woman fall fainting to the ground.
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere had seen all, heard all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor woman!&rdquo; muttered D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he helped the attendants to carry
      back to her carriage the lonely lady whose lot henceforth in life was
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening D&rsquo;Artagnan was seated at the king&rsquo;s table, near M. Colbert
      and M. le Duc d&rsquo;Almeda. The king was very gay. He paid a thousand little
      attentions to the queen, a thousand kindnesses to Madame, seated at his
      left hand, and very sad. It might have been supposed that time of calm
      when the king was wont to watch his mother&rsquo;s eyes for the approval or
      disapproval of what he had just done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of mistresses there was no question at this dinner. The king addressed
      Aramis two or three times, calling him M. l&rsquo;ambassadeur, which increased
      the surprise already felt by D&rsquo;Artagnan at seeing his friend the rebel so
      marvelously well received at court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, on rising from table, gave his hand to the queen, and made a
      sign to Colbert, whose eye was on his master&rsquo;s face. Colbert took
      D&rsquo;Artagnan and Aramis on one side. The king began to chat with his sister,
      whilst Monsieur, very uneasy, entertained the queen with a preoccupied
      air, without ceasing to watch his wife and brother from the corner of his
      eye. The conversation between Aramis, D&rsquo;Artagnan, and Colbert turned upon
      indifferent subjects. They spoke of preceding ministers; Colbert related
      the successful tricks of Mazarin, and desired those of Richelieu to be
      related to him. D&rsquo;Artagnan could not overcome his surprise at finding this
      man, with his heavy eyebrows and low forehead, display so much sound
      knowledge and cheerful spirits. Aramis was astonished at that lightness of
      character which permitted this serious man to retard with advantage the
      moment for more important conversation, to which nobody made any allusion,
      although all three interlocutors felt its imminence. It was very plain,
      from the embarrassed appearance of Monsieur, how much the conversation of
      the king and Madame annoyed him. Madame&rsquo;s eyes were almost red: was she
      going to complain? Was she going to expose a little scandal in open court?
      The king took her on one side, and in a tone so tender that it must have
      reminded the princess of the time when she was loved for herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why do I see tears in those lovely eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;sire&mdash;&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is jealous, is he not, sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked towards Monsieur, an infallible sign that they were talking
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;if your friends compromise you, it is not
      Monsieur&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke these words with so much kindness that Madame, encouraged, having
      borne so many solitary griefs so long, was nearly bursting into tears, so
      full was her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, dear little sister,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;tell me your griefs; on
      the word of a brother, I pity them; on the word of a king, I will put an
      end to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her glorious eyes and, in a melancholy tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my friends who compromise me,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;they are either
      absent or concealed; they have been brought into disgrace with your
      majesty; they, so devoted, so good, so loyal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say this on account of De Guiche, whom I have exiled, at Monsieur&rsquo;s
      desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who, since that unjust exile, has endeavored to get himself killed
      once every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unjust, say you, sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So unjust, that if I had not had the respect mixed with friendship that I
      have always entertained for your majesty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I would have asked my brother Charles, upon whom I can always&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king started. &ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have asked him to have had it represented to you that Monsieur
      and his favorite M. le Chevalier de Lorraine ought not with impunity to
      constitute themselves the executioners of my honor and my happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier de Lorraine,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;that dismal fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my mortal enemy. Whilst that man lives in my household, where Monsieur
      retains him and delegates his power to him, I shall be the most miserable
      woman in the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the king, slowly, &ldquo;you call your brother of England a better
      friend than I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actions speak for themselves, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would prefer going to ask assistance there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my own country!&rdquo; said she with pride; &ldquo;yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the grandchild of Henry IV. as well as myself, lady. Cousin and
      brother-in-law, does not that amount pretty well to the title of
      brother-germain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Henrietta, &ldquo;act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us form an alliance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, you say, unjustly exiled De Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; said she, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Guiche shall return.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10"
       id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you say that I do wrong in having in your household the Chevalier
      de Lorraine, who gives Monsieur ill advice respecting you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember well what I tell you, sire; the Chevalier de Lorraine some day&mdash;Observe,
      if ever I come to a dreadful end, I beforehand accuse the Chevalier de
      Lorraine; he has a spirit that is capable of any crime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier de Lorraine shall no longer annoy you&mdash;I promise you
      that.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that will be a true preliminary of alliance, sire,&mdash;I sign; but
      since you have done your part, tell me what shall be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of embroiling me with your brother Charles, you must make him a
      more intimate friend than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not quite so easy as you may suppose, for in ordinary friendship
      people embrace or exercise hospitality, and that only costs a kiss or a
      return, profitable expenses; but in political friendship&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s a political friendship, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my sister; and then, instead of embraces and feasts, it is soldiers&mdash;it
      is soldiers all alive and well equipped&mdash;that we must serve up to our
      friends; vessels we must offer, all armed with cannons and stored with
      provisions. It hence results that we have not always coffers in a fit
      condition for such friendships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are quite right,&rdquo; said Madame; &ldquo;the coffers of the king of
      England have been sonorous for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, my sister, who have so much influence over your brother, you can
      secure more than an ambassador could ever get the promise of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To effect that I must go to London, my dear brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought so,&rdquo; replied the king, eagerly; &ldquo;and I have said to myself
      that such a voyage would do your health and spirits good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; interrupted Madame, &ldquo;it is possible I should fail. The king of
      England has dangerous counselors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counselors, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. If, by chance, your majesty had any intention&mdash;I am only
      supposing so&mdash;of asking Charles II. his alliance in a war&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; well! then the king&rsquo;s counselors, who are in number seven&mdash;Mademoiselle
      Stewart, Mademoiselle Wells, Mademoiselle Gwyn, Miss Orchay, Mademoiselle
      Zunga, Miss Davies, and the proud Countess of Castlemaine&mdash;will
      represent to the king that war costs a great deal of money; that it is
      better to give balls and suppers at Hampton Court than to equip ships of
      the line at Portsmouth and Greenwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then your negotiations will fail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! those ladies cause all negotiations to fall through which they don&rsquo;t
      make themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the idea that has struck me, sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; inform me what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that, searching well around you, you might perhaps find a female
      counselor to take with you to your brother, whose eloquence might paralyze
      the ill-will of the seven others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is really an idea, sire, and I will search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty ambassadress is necessary; an agreeable face is better than an
      ugly one, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An animated, lively, audacious character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobility; that is, enough to enable her to approach the king without
      awkwardness&mdash;not too lofty, so as not to trouble herself about the
      dignity of her race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who knows a little English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> why, some one,&rdquo; cried Madame, &ldquo;like Mademoiselle de
      Keroualle, for instance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! why, yes!&rdquo; said Louis XIV.; &ldquo;you have hit the mark,&mdash;it is you
      who have found, my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take her; she will have no cause to complain, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, I will name her <i>seductrice plenipotentiaire</i> at once, and
      will add a dowry to the title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you already on your road, my dear little sister, consoled for all
      your griefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go, on two conditions. The first is, that I shall know what I am
      negotiating about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is it. The Dutch, you know, insult me daily in their gazettes, and
      by their republican attitude. I do not like republics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may easily be imagined, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see with pain that these kings of the sea&mdash;they call themselves so&mdash;keep
      trade from France in the Indies, and that their vessels will soon occupy
      all the ports of Europe. Such a power is too near me, sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are your allies, nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why they were wrong in having the medal you have heard of struck;
      a medal which represents Holland stopping the sun, as Joshua did, with
      this legend: <i>The sun had stopped before me</i>. There is not much
      fraternity in that, <i>is</i> there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had forgotten that miserable episode?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget anything, sister. And if my true friends, such as your
      brother Charles, are willing to second me&mdash;&rdquo; The princess remained
      pensively silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me; there is the empire of the seas to be shared,&rdquo; said Louis
      XIV. &ldquo;For this partition, which England submits to, could I not represent
      the second party as well as the Dutch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have Mademoiselle de Keroualle to treat that question,&rdquo; replied
      Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your second condition for going, if you please, sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The consent of Monsieur, my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then consider me already gone, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these words, Louis XIV. turned round towards the corner of the
      room in which D&rsquo;Artagnan, Colbert, and Aramis stood, and made an
      affirmative sign to his minister. Colbert then broke in on the
      conversation suddenly, and said to Aramis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;ambassadeur, shall we talk about business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan immediately withdrew, from politeness. He directed his steps
      towards the fireplace, within hearing of what the king was about to say to
      Monsieur, who, evidently uneasy, had gone to him. The face of the king was
      animated. Upon his brow was stamped a strength of will, the expression of
      which already met no further contradiction in France, and was soon to meet
      no more in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the king to his brother, &ldquo;I am not pleased with M. le
      Chevalier de Lorraine. You, who do him the honor to protect him, must
      advise him to travel for a few months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words fell with the crush of an avalanche upon Monsieur, who adored
      his favorite, and concentrated all his affections in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what has the chevalier been inconsiderate enough to displease your
      majesty?&rdquo; cried he, darting a furious look at Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you that when he is gone,&rdquo; said the king, suavely. &ldquo;And also
      when Madame, here, shall have crossed over into England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame! in England!&rdquo; murmured Monsieur, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a week, brother,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;whilst we will go whither I
      will shortly tell you.&rdquo; And the king turned on his heel, smiling in his
      brother&rsquo;s face, to sweeten, as it were, the bitter draught he had given
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Colbert was talking with the Duc d&rsquo;Almeda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Colbert to Aramis, &ldquo;this is the moment for us to come to
      an understanding. I have made your peace with the king, and I owed that
      clearly to a man of so much merit; but as you have often expressed
      friendship for me, an opportunity presents itself for giving me a proof of
      it. You are, besides, more a Frenchman than a Spaniard. Shall we secure&mdash;answer
      me frankly&mdash;the neutrality of Spain, if we undertake anything against
      the United Provinces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Aramis, &ldquo;the interest of Spain is clear. To embroil
      Europe with the Provinces would doubtless be our policy, but the king of
      France is an ally of the United Provinces. You are not ignorant, besides,
      that it would infer a maritime war, and that France is in no state to
      undertake this with advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert, turning round at this moment, saw D&rsquo;Artagnan who was seeking some
      interlocutor, during this &ldquo;aside&rdquo; of the king and Monsieur. He called him,
      at the same time saying in a low voice to Aramis, &ldquo;We may talk openly with
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; replied the ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were saying, M. d&rsquo;Almeda and I,&rdquo; said Colbert, &ldquo;that a conflict with
      the United Provinces would mean a maritime war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s evident enough,&rdquo; replied the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of it, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that to carry on such a war successfully, you must have very
      large land forces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; said Colbert, thinking he had ill understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why such a large land army?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the king will be beaten by sea if he has not the English with
      him, and that when beaten by sea, he will soon be invaded, either by the
      Dutch in his ports, or by the Spaniards by land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Spain neutral?&rdquo; asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neutral as long as the king shall prove stronger,&rdquo; rejoined D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colbert admired that sagacity which never touched a question without
      enlightening it thoroughly. Aramis smiled, as he had long known that in
      diplomacy D&rsquo;Artagnan acknowledged no superior. Colbert, who, like all
      proud men, dwelt upon his fantasy with a certainty of success, resumed the
      subject, &ldquo;Who told you, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, that the king had no navy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I take no heed of these details,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;I am but an
      indifferent sailor. Like all nervous people, I hate the sea; and yet I
      have an idea that, with ships, France being a seaport with two hundred
      exits, we might have sailors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert drew from his pocket a little oblong book divided into two
      columns. On the first were the names of vessels, on the other the figures
      recapitulating the number of cannon and men requisite to equip these
      ships. &ldquo;I have had the same idea as you,&rdquo; said he to D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;and I
      have had an account drawn up of the vessels we have altogether&mdash;thirty-five
      ships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-five ships! impossible!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like two thousand pieces of cannon,&rdquo; said Colbert. &ldquo;That is
      what the king possesses at this moment. Of five and thirty vessels we can
      make three squadrons, but I must have five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five!&rdquo; cried Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be afloat before the end of the year, gentlemen; the king will
      have fifty ship of the line. We may venture on a contest with them, may we
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To build vessels,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;is difficult, but possible. As to
      arming them, how is that to be done? In France there are neither foundries
      nor military docks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; replied Colbert, in a bantering tone, &ldquo;I have planned all that this
      year and a half past, did you not know it? Do you know M. d&rsquo;Imfreville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Imfreville?&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man I have discovered; he has a specialty; he is a man of genius&mdash;he
      knows how to set men to work. It is he who has cast cannon and cut the
      woods of Bourgogne. And then, monsieur l&rsquo;ambassadeur, you may not believe
      what I am going to tell you, but I have a still further idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur!&rdquo; said Aramis, civilly, &ldquo;I always believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calculating upon the character of the Dutch, our allies, I said to
      myself, &lsquo;They are merchants, they are friendly with the king; they will be
      happy to sell to the king what they fabricate for themselves; then the
      more we buy&rsquo;&mdash;Ah! I must add this: I have Forant&mdash;do you know
      Forant, D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert, in his warmth, forgot himself; he called the captain simply <i>D&rsquo;Artagnan</i>,
      as the king did. But the captain only smiled at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I do not know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is another man I have discovered, with a genius for buying. This
      Forant has purchased for me 350,000 pounds of iron in balls, 200,000
      pounds of powder, twelve cargoes of Northern timber, matches, grenades,
      pitch, tar&mdash;I know not what! with a saving of seven per cent upon
      what all those articles would cost me fabricated in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a capital and quaint idea,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;to have Dutch
      cannon-balls cast which will return to the Dutch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not, with loss, too?&rdquo; And Colbert laughed aloud. He was delighted
      with his own joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still further,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;these same Dutch are building for the king, at
      this moment, six vessels after the model of the best of their name.
      Destouches&mdash;Ah! perhaps you don&rsquo;t know Destouches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man who has a sure glance to discern, when a ship is launched,
      what are the defects and qualities of that ship&mdash;that is valuable,
      observe! Nature is truly whimsical. Well, this Destouches appeared to me
      to be a man likely to prove useful in marine affairs, and he is
      superintending the construction of six vessels of seventy-eight guns,
      which the Provinces are building for his majesty. It results from this, my
      dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, that the king, if he wished to quarrel with the
      Provinces, would have a very pretty fleet. Now, you know better than
      anybody else if the land army is efficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan and Aramis looked at each other, wondering at the mysterious
      labors this man had undertaken in so short a time. Colbert understood
      them, and was touched by this best of flatteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we, in France, were ignorant of what was going on,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      &ldquo;out of France still less must be known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I told monsieur l&rsquo;ambassadeur,&rdquo; said Colbert, &ldquo;that, Spain
      promising its neutrality, England helping us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If England assists you,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;I promise the neutrality of
      Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take you at your word,&rdquo; Colbert hastened to reply with his blunt <i>bonhomie</i>.
      &ldquo;And, <i>a propos</i> of Spain, you have not the &lsquo;Golden Fleece,&rsquo; Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Almeda. I heard the king say the other day that he should like to see
      you wear the <i>grand cordon</i> of St. Michael.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis bowed. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;and Porthos is no longer here!
      What ells of ribbons would there be for him in these <i>largesses!</i>
      Dear Porthos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; resumed Colbert, &ldquo;between us two, you will have, I
      wager, an inclination to lead your musketeers into Holland. Can you swim?&rdquo;
       And he laughed like a man in high good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like an eel,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but there are some bitter passages of canals and marshes yonder,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, and the best swimmers are sometimes drowned there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my profession to die for his majesty,&rdquo; said the musketeer. &ldquo;Only,
      as it is seldom in war that much water is met with without a little fire,
      I declare to you beforehand, that I will do my best to choose fire. I am
      getting old; water freezes me&mdash;but fire warms, Monsieur Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And D&rsquo;Artagnan looked so handsome still in quasi-juvenile strength as he
      pronounced these words, that Colbert, in his turn, could not help admiring
      him. D&rsquo;Artagnan perceived the effect he had produced. He remembered that
      the best tradesman is he who fixes a high price upon his goods, when they
      are valuable. He prepared his price in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then,&rdquo; said Colbert, &ldquo;we go into Holland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only?&rdquo; said M. Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; repeated D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;there lurks in everything the question of
      interest, the question of self-love. It is a very fine title, that of
      captain of the musketeers; but observe this: we have now the king&rsquo;s guards
      and the military household of the king. A captain of musketeers ought to
      command all that, and then he would absorb a hundred thousand livres a
      year for expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! but do you suppose the king would haggle with you?&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! monsieur, you have not understood me,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, sure of
      carrying his point. &ldquo;I was telling you that I, an old captain, formerly
      chief of the king&rsquo;s guard, having precedence of the <i>marechaux</i> of
      France&mdash;I saw myself one day in the trenches with two other equals,
      the captain of the guards and the colonel commanding the Swiss. Now, at no
      price will I suffer that. I have old habits, and I will stand or fall by
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert felt this blow, but he was prepared for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking of what you said just now,&rdquo; replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of canals and marshes in which people are drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! if they are drowned, it is for want of a boat, a plank, or a
      stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a stick, however short it may be,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Colbert. &ldquo;And, therefore, I never heard of an instance of
      a <i>marechal</i> of France being drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan became very pale with joy, and in a not very firm voice,
      &ldquo;People would be very proud of me in my country,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I were a <i>marechal</i>
      of France; but a man must have commanded an expedition in chief to obtain
      the <i>baton</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; said Colbert, &ldquo;here is in this pocket-book which you will
      study, a plan of campaign you will have to lead a body of troops to carry
      out in the next spring.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12"
       id="linknoteref-12"><small>12</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan took the book, tremblingly, and his fingers meeting those of
      Colbert, the minister pressed the hand of the musketeer loyally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we had both a revenge to take, one over the other. I
      have begun; it is now your turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do you justice, monsieur,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;and implore you to
      tell the king that the first opportunity that shall offer, he may depend
      upon a victory, or to behold me dead&mdash;<i>or both</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will have the <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> for your <i>marechal&rsquo;s baton</i>
      prepared immediately,&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, Aramis, who was setting out for Madrid, to negotiate the
      neutrality of Spain, came to embrace D&rsquo;Artagnan at his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us love each other for four,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;We are now but two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will, perhaps, never see me again, dear D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said Aramis;
      &ldquo;if you knew how I have loved you! I am old, I am extinct&mdash;ah, I am
      almost dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you will live longer than I shall:
      diplomacy commands you to live; but, for my part, honor condemns me to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! such men as we are, monsieur le marechal,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;only die
      satisfied with joy in glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a melancholy smile, &ldquo;I assure you, monsieur
      le duc, I feel very little appetite for either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They once more embraced, and, two hours after, separated&mdash;forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Death of D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to that which generally happens, whether in politics or morals,
      each kept his promises, and did honor to his engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king recalled M. de Guiche, and banished M. le Chevalier de Lorraine;
      so that Monsieur became ill in consequence. Madame set out for London,
      where she applied herself so earnestly to make her brother, Charles II.,
      acquire a taste for the political counsels of Mademoiselle de Keroualle,
      that the alliance between England and France was signed, and the English
      vessels, ballasted by a few millions of French gold, made a terrible
      campaign against the fleets of the United Provinces. Charles II. had
      promised Mademoiselle de Keroualle a little gratitude for her good
      counsels; he made her Duchess of Portsmouth. Colbert had promised the king
      vessels, munitions, victories. He kept his word, as is well known. At
      length Aramis, upon whose promises there was least dependence to be
      placed, wrote Colbert the following letter, on the subject of the
      negotiations which he had undertaken at Madrid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MONSIEUR COLBERT,&mdash;I have the honor to expedite to you the R. P.
      Oliva, general <i>ad interim</i> of the Society of Jesus, my provisional
      successor. The reverend father will explain to you, Monsieur Colbert, that
      I preserve to myself the direction of all the affairs of the order which
      concern France and Spain; but that I am not willing to retain the title of
      general, which would throw too high a side-light on the progress of the
      negotiations with which His Catholic Majesty wishes to intrust me. I shall
      resume that title by the command of his majesty, when the labors I have
      undertaken in concert with you, for the great glory of God and His Church,
      shall be brought to a good end. The R. P. Oliva will inform you likewise,
      monsieur, of the consent His Catholic Majesty gives to the signature of a
      treaty which assures the neutrality of Spain in the event of a war between
      France and the United Provinces. This consent will be valid even if
      England, instead of being active, should satisfy herself with remaining
      neutral. As for Portugal, of which you and I have spoken, monsieur, I can
      assure you it will contribute with all its resources to assist the Most
      Christian King in his war. I beg you, Monsieur Colbert, to preserve your
      friendship and also to believe in my profound attachment, and to lay my
      respect at the feet of His Most Christian Majesty. Signed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LE DUC D&rsquo;ALMEDA.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13"
       id="linknoteref-13"><small>13</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis had performed more than he had promised; it remained to be seen how
      the king, M. Colbert, and D&rsquo;Artagnan would be faithful to each other. In
      the spring, as Colbert had predicted, the land army entered on its
      campaign. It preceded, in magnificent order, the court of Louis XIV., who,
      setting out on horseback, surrounded by carriages filled with ladies and
      courtiers, conducted the <i>elite</i> of his kingdom to this sanguinary <i>fete</i>.
      The officers of the army, it is true, had no other music save the
      artillery of the Dutch forts; but it was enough for a great number, who
      found in this war honor, advancement, fortune&mdash;or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. d&rsquo;Artagnan set out commanding a body of twelve thousand men, cavalry,
      and infantry, with which he was ordered to take the different places which
      form knots of that strategic network called La Frise. Never was an army
      conducted more gallantly to an expedition. The officers knew that their
      leader, prudent and skillful as he was brave, would not sacrifice a single
      man, nor yield an inch of ground without necessity. He had the old habits
      of war, to live upon the country, keeping his soldiers singing and the
      enemy weeping. The captain of the king&rsquo;s musketeers well knew his
      business. Never were opportunities better chosen, <i>coups-de-main</i>
      better supported, errors of the besieged more quickly taken advantage of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army commanded by D&rsquo;Artagnan took twelve small places within a month.
      He was engaged in besieging the thirteenth, which had held out five days.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan caused the trenches to be opened without appearing to suppose
      that these people would ever allow themselves to be taken. The pioneers
      and laborers were, in the army of this man, a body full of ideas and zeal,
      because their commander treated them like soldiers, knew how to render
      their work glorious, and never allowed them to be killed if he could help
      it. It should have been seen with what eagerness the marshy glebes of
      Holland were turned over. Those turf-heaps, mounds of potter&rsquo;s clay,
      melted at the word of the soldiers like butter in the frying-pans of
      Friesland housewives.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. d&rsquo;Artagnan dispatched a courier to the king to give him an account of
      the last success, which redoubled the good humor of his majesty and his
      inclination to amuse the ladies. These victories of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan gave so
      much majesty to the prince, that Madame de Montespan no longer called him
      anything but Louis the Invincible. So that Mademoiselle de la Valliere,
      who only called the king Louis the Victorious, lost much of his majesty&rsquo;s
      favor. Besides, her eyes were frequently red, and to an Invincible nothing
      is more disagreeable than a mistress who weeps while everything is smiling
      round her. The star of Mademoiselle de la Valliere was being drowned in
      clouds and tears. But the gayety of Madame de Montespan redoubled with the
      successes of the king, and consoled him for every other unpleasant
      circumstance. It was to D&rsquo;Artagnan the king owed this; and his majesty was
      anxious to acknowledge these services; he wrote to M. Colbert:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MONSIEUR COLBERT,&mdash;We have a promise to fulfil with M. d&rsquo;Artagnan,
      who so well keeps his. This is to inform you that the time is come for
      performing it. All provisions for this purpose you shall be furnished with
      in due time. LOUIS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of this, Colbert, detaining D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s envoy, placed in
      the hands of that messenger a letter from himself, and a small coffer of
      ebony inlaid with gold, not very important in appearance, but which,
      without doubt, was very heavy, as a guard of five men was given to the
      messenger, to assist him in carrying it. These people arrived before the
      place which D&rsquo;Artagnan was besieging towards daybreak, and presented
      themselves at the lodgings of the general. They were told that M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan, annoyed by a sortie which the governor, an artful man, had
      made the evening before, and in which the works had been destroyed and
      seventy-seven men killed, and the reparation of the breaches commenced,
      had just gone with twenty companies of grenadiers to reconstruct the
      works.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Colbert&rsquo;s envoy had orders to go and seek M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, wherever he
      might be, or at whatever hour of the day or night. He directed his course,
      therefore, towards the trenches, followed by his escort, all on horseback.
      They perceived M. d&rsquo;Artagnan in the open plain, with his gold-laced hat,
      his long cane, and gilt cuffs. He was biting his white mustache, and
      wiping off, with his left hand, the dust which the passing balls threw up
      from the ground they plowed so near him. They also saw, amidst this
      terrible fire, which filled the air with whistling hisses, officers
      handling the shovel, soldiers rolling barrows, and vast fascines, rising
      by being either carried or dragged by from ten to twenty men, cover the
      front of the trench reopened to the center by this extraordinary effort of
      the general. In three hours, all was reinstated. D&rsquo;Artagnan began to speak
      more mildly; and he became quite calm when the captain of the pioneers
      approached him, hat in hand, to tell him that the trench was again in
      proper order. This man had scarcely finished speaking, when a ball took
      off one of his legs, and he fell into the arms of D&rsquo;Artagnan. The latter
      lifted up his soldier, and quietly, with soothing words, carried him into
      the trench, amidst the enthusiastic applause of the regiments. From that
      time it was no longer a question of valor&mdash;the army was delirious;
      two companies stole away to the advanced posts, which they instantly
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their comrades, restrained with great difficulty by D&rsquo;Artagnan, saw
      them lodged upon the bastions, they rushed forward likewise; and soon a
      furious assault was made upon the counterscarp, upon which depended the
      safety of the place. D&rsquo;Artagnan perceived there was only one means left of
      checking his army&mdash;to take the place. He directed all his force to
      the two breaches, where the besieged were busy in repairing. The shock was
      terrible; eighteen companies took part in it, and D&rsquo;Artagnan went with the
      rest, within half cannon-shot of the place, to support the attack by <i>echelons</i>.
      The cries of the Dutch, who were being poniarded upon their guns by
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s grenadiers, were distinctly audible. The struggle grew
      fiercer with the despair of the governor, who disputed his position foot
      by foot. D&rsquo;Artagnan, to put an end to the affair, and to silence the fire,
      which was unceasing, sent a fresh column, which penetrated like a very
      wedge; and he soon perceived upon the ramparts, through the fire, the
      terrified flight of the besieged, pursued by the besiegers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the general, breathing feely and full of joy, heard a voice
      behind him, saying, &ldquo;Monsieur, if you please, from M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke the seal of the letter, which contained these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MONSIEUR D&rsquo;ARTAGNAN:&mdash;The king commands me to inform you that he has
      nominated you marechal of France, as a reward for your magnificent
      services, and the honor you do to his arms. The king is highly pleased,
      monsieur, with the captures you have made; he commands you, in particular,
      to finish the siege you have commenced, with good fortune to you, and
      success for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was standing with a radiant countenance and sparkling eye. He
      looked up to watch the progress of his troops upon the walls, still
      enveloped in red and black volumes of smoke. &ldquo;I have finished,&rdquo; replied he
      to the messenger; &ldquo;the city will have surrendered in a quarter of an
      hour.&rdquo; He then resumed his reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>coffret</i>, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, is my own present. You will not
      be sorry to see that, whilst you warriors are drawing the sword to defend
      the king, I am moving the pacific arts to ornament a present worthy of
      you. I commend myself to your friendship, monsieur le marechal, and beg
      you to believe in mine. COLBERT&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, intoxicated with joy, made a sign to the messenger, who
      approached, with his <i>coffret</i> in his hands. But at the moment the <i>marechal</i>
      was going to look at it, a loud explosion resounded from the ramparts, and
      called his attention towards the city. &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t yet see the king&rsquo;s flag on the walls, or hear the drums beat
      the <i>chamade</i>.&rdquo; He launched three hundred fresh men, under a
      high-spirited officer, and ordered another breach to be made. Then, more
      tranquilly, he turned towards the <i>coffret</i>, which Colbert&rsquo;s envoy
      held out to him.&mdash;It was his treasure&mdash;he had won it.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was holding out his hand to open the <i>coffret</i>, when a
      ball from the city crushed the <i>coffret</i> in the arms of the officer,
      struck D&rsquo;Artagnan full in the chest, and knocked him down upon a sloping
      heap of earth, whilst the <i>fleur-de-lised baton</i>, escaping from the
      broken box, came rolling under the powerless hand of the <i>marechal</i>.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan endeavored to raise himself. It was thought he had been knocked
      down without being wounded. A terrible cry broke from the group of
      terrified officers; the <i>marechal</i> was covered with blood; the pallor
      of death ascended slowly to his noble countenance. Leaning upon the arms
      held out on all sides to receive him, he was able once more to turn his
      eyes towards the place, and to distinguish the white flag at the crest of
      the principal bastion; his ears, already deaf to the sounds of life,
      caught feebly the rolling of the drum which announced the victory. Then,
      clasping in his nerveless hand the <i>baton</i>, ornamented with its <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>,
      he cast on it his eyes, which had no longer the power of looking upwards
      towards Heaven, and fell back, murmuring strange words, which appeared to
      the soldiers cabalistic&mdash;words which had formerly represented so many
      things on earth, and which none but the dying man any longer comprehended:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athos&mdash;Porthos, farewell till we meet again! Aramis, adieu forever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the four valiant men whose history we have related, there now remained
      but one. Heaven had taken to itself three noble souls. <a

      <h3>
        TRANSCRIBER&rsquo;S NOTE:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a multi volume file
      </p>
      <p>
        The index has links to all volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two html files in each zipped html folder. The .....-h.htm
        file should be used if you wish to use a downloaded file off-line which
        will link to all the other files in the set which are still on-line. The
        .....-h2.htm file will be used only if you wish to build a complete
        off-line set of files as the links in this html file are designed only
        for off-line use. If you want to download all three volumes and have the
        links work on your own computer, then follow these directions carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Create a directory (folder) named whatever you like (e.g.,
        Maupassant). (The name of this directory (folder) is not critical, but
        the inner folders <i>must</i> be named as listed below, or the links
        between volumes will <i>not</i> work).
      </p>
      <p>
        2. In that directory (folder) create as many directories (folders) as
        there are volumes in the set and name each of new folders after the
        original filename, for example:
      </p>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>
          20023
        </li>
        <li>
          24780
        </li>
        <li>
          28649
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        3. In each of the above directories you just created, create a directory
        of the same filename but this time in the pattern:
      </p>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>
          In the 20023 directory create a directory named 20023-h
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 24780 directory create a directory named 24780-h
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 28649 directory create a directory named 28649-h
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        4. Download the <i>zipped</i> html version of each volume from the PG
        Catalog.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Unzip the downloaded files, you will find an html directory for
        example 20023-h which contains two html files named, for example,
        20023-h.htm and 20023-h2.htm
      </p>
      <ul class="nonetn">
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 20023-h2.htm file and its &ldquo;images&rdquo; directory into
          your new 20023-h directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 24780-h2.htm file and its &ldquo;images&rdquo; directory into
          your new 24780-h directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 28649-h2.htm file and its &ldquo;images&rdquo; directory into
          your new 28649-h directory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="short" />
      <p>
        Rename each of the html files by removing the number 2 at the end of the
        filename so for each you have, for example, 20023-h2.htm changed to
        20023-h.htm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
